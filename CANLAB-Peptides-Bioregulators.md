### Epitalon Protocol (FLAGSHIP)

**Protocol Card**: Epitalon | Anti-Aging/Telomerase/Sleep | Evidence: C–D | Risk: Low–Moderate

## Protocol Card (Top Summary)

**Protocol name**: Epitalon Anti-Aging & Longevity Protocol
**Category**: Anti-Aging | Telomerase Activation | Sleep Optimization | Circadian Support
**Status label**: Research-only / Investigational
**Evidence grade**: C–D (Limited human trials; mechanistic theory; Russian clinical use)
**Risk tier**: Low–Moderate
**Ideal candidate**: Anti-aging protocols (>40 years), sleep quality optimization, longevity-focused individuals
**Not a fit for**: Cancer history (theoretical telomerase concern), pregnancy, psychiatric disease

#### Quick outcomes
- **Primary goal**: Anti-aging support, sleep quality improvement, circadian optimization
- **What you may notice first**: Improved sleep, energy, circadian alignment (2–4 weeks)
- **What takes longer**: Subjective anti-aging benefits (8–12+ weeks)
- **How we judge success**: Sleep quality (subjective), energy levels, general wellness markers

#### Protocol Details
- **Dosing**: 5–10 mg SC, variable schedules:
  - **Intensive**: 10 mg daily for 10–20 days (loading), then 10 mg weekly or monthly maintenance
  - **Moderate**: 5 mg 3x/week for 4–8 weeks
- **Route**: Subcutaneous injection
- **Duration**: 8–16 weeks; cycling common (10 days on, 20 days off)

#### Mechanism
Tetrapeptide (Ala-Glu-Asp-Gly) that may activate telomerase, support pineal gland function, optimize melatonin production, and regulate circadian rhythms. Anti-aging effects theoretical (telomere lengthening claimed but not definitively proven in humans).

#### Safety
- **Common**: Minimal (headache rare, mood changes rare)
- **Serious warnings**: Telomerase activation concern in cancer (theoretical; telomerase could theoretically promote tumor growth; unproven but caution warranted)
- **Contraindications**: Cancer history (caution), pregnancy, psychiatric conditions

#### Synergy Stack
- DSIP (sleep synergy)
- Thymosin-α1 (immune support)
- Sermorelin (GH axis)
- NAD+ precursors (NMN/NR - mitochondrial)
- Omega-3, Magnesium

#### Evidence
Russian clinical use reported (Khavinson studies); limited peer-reviewed English-language trials; mechanism plausible but unproven in healthy humans.

## KEY REMINDERS FOR BIOREGULATOR USE

**1. Very Limited Human Data**
- Most Russian bioregulators have no English-language human trials
- Mechanism is theoretical; effects unproven in healthy humans
- Use as complementary support, not primary therapy

**2. Evidence Grade Limitations**
- Most are Evidence D–E (animal/mechanistic)
- Some have C-level case series (Thymosin-α1, Epitalon)
- Few have B-level human trials (Sermorelin)

**3. Safety Profile**
- Generally considered safe (low side-effect burden reported)
- Long-term effects unknown (most research <12 weeks)
- Quality/purity varies significantly by supplier

**4. Cost-Benefit**
- Individual bioregulators are inexpensive ($35–50 per vial)
- Benefits are often subjective (energy, recovery, general wellbeing)
- Full effect may take 8–16 weeks to manifest

**5. Realistic Expectations**
- Bioregulators support aging optimization, not cure disease
- Best used as part of comprehensive lifestyle (sleep, exercise, nutrition, stress management)
- Synergistic with other peptides but not essential
