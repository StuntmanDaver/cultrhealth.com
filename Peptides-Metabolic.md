## Protocol Card (Top Summary)

**Protocol name**: Cagrilintide Weight Loss & Metabolic Protocol
**Category**: Weight Loss | Appetite Control | Metabolic Health | Body Recomposition
**Status label**: Investigational / Research-only (similar mechanism to semaglutide; not widely FDA-approved as standalone)
**Evidence grade**: B–C (Human trials emerging; mechanistic solid)
**Risk tier**: Moderate
**Ideal candidate**: Overweight/obesity (BMI >27), metabolic syndrome, T2D support, appetite control, sustained weight loss with muscle preservation
**Not a fit for**: Pregnancy, personal/family history of medullary thyroid cancer (MTC), pancreatitis history, gastroparesis, severe GI disease

#### Quick outcomes
- **Primary goal**: 3–8 lbs/month fat loss, appetite reduction 50–70%, improved metabolic markers
- **What you may notice first**: Appetite reduction, nausea (common initially), reduced food cravings (2–7 days)
- **What takes longer**: Measurable weight loss, improved insulin sensitivity, lipid profile changes (4–8 weeks)
- **How we judge success**: Weight loss (weekly), body composition (monthly DEXA/BodPod), strength maintenance, GI tolerance, glucose/lipid labs

#### What this protocol includes
- **Core compound**: Cagrilintide 0.25–2.4 mg SC weekly (slow escalation over 8–12 weeks to minimize nausea)
- **Synergy stack**: High protein (1.4–1.6g/lb - CRITICAL for muscle preservation), creatine, magnesium, omega-3, probiotics (GI tolerance), electrolytes
- **Training pairing**: Strength training 3–5x/week (priority - prevent muscle loss), Zone 2 cardio 2–3x/week
- **Monitoring**: Weekly weight, daily GI symptoms, strength logs (ensure maintained), monthly body comp, baseline + follow-up labs (glucose, lipids)

#### Safety at a glance
- **Common side effects**: Nausea (60–70% users initially; severe in 20%; usually improves by week 3–4), vomiting, constipation, diarrhea, appetite loss, fatigue, headache
- **Serious warnings**: Pancreatitis (0.1–1%; severe abdominal pain = emergency); medullary thyroid cancer concern (theoretical; C-cell hyperplasia in rodents; black box warning on similar GLP-1 drugs); rapid weight loss can worsen diabetic retinopathy; muscle loss if protein/training inadequate
- **Do NOT use if**: Personal/family history of MTC, Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia syndrome type 2 (MEN 2), pancreatitis history, pregnancy, gastroparesis (slowed gastric emptying worsens condition)
- **Use caution if**: Diabetic retinopathy (rapid glucose lowering can worsen), renal impairment, history of GI disease, taking other GLP-1 drugs

---

## 1) Patient Eligibility

**Best-fit profile**:
- BMI >27 (overweight/obese), willing to commit to caloric deficit + strength training + high protein
- Metabolic syndrome, pre-diabetes, T2D support (in addition to standard care)
- Behavioral eating patterns (binge eating, emotional eating, food cravings) responsive to appetite suppression
- Willing to tolerate initial GI side effects (nausea common; improves with slow titration)

**Not recommended**: Pregnancy, MTC/MEN 2 history (absolute contraindication), pancreatitis history, gastroparesis, severe GI disease, teens (<18 typically)

**When we use caution**: Diabetic retinopathy (monitor closely; rapid glucose drop can worsen), renal impairment (dose adjustment may be needed), concurrent GLP-1 use (additive effects; not recommended)

---

## 2) Expected Benefits (Ranked)

| Benefit | Evidence | How We Measure |
|---------|----------|----------------|
| **Appetite suppression** | B (Strong RCT data) | Subjective appetite scale (0–10), food intake logs, satiety duration |
| **Weight loss** | B (3–8 lbs/month in trials with deficit) | Weekly weight, monthly body comp (DEXA/BodPod preferred) |
| **Improved insulin sensitivity** | B (glucose control in T2D trials) | Fasting glucose, HbA1c, HOMA-IR (if available) |
| **Cardiovascular benefit** | B–C (emerging cardiovascular outcome trials) | BP, lipid panel (total cholesterol, LDL, HDL, triglycerides) |
| **Reduced food cravings** | C (anecdotal + mechanistic) | Subjective craving assessment, behavioral food patterns |

---

## 3) Downsides

- **Significant GI side effects**: Nausea (60–70% initially; severe in ~20%), vomiting, constipation; usually improves by week 3–4 but can persist; slow titration essential
- **Muscle loss risk**: Aggressive deficit + GLP-1 = lean mass loss if protein <1.4g/lb or training inadequate; monitor strength weekly
- **Slow titration required**: 8–12 weeks to reach therapeutic dose; faster = intolerable nausea + compliance failure
- **Pancreatitis risk**: Rare (0.1–1%) but serious; severe abdominal pain = stop immediately, seek emergency care
- **Cost**: $90–170/vial depending on dose; ongoing expense ($200–400/month depending on dose)
- **Reasons to stop**: Intolerable GI symptoms, muscle loss, pancreatitis, cost, lifestyle incompatibility

---

## 4) Mechanism

**Plain English**: Cagrilintide activates GLP-1 receptors in your brain and gut, slowing how fast food leaves your stomach (you feel full longer) and reducing hunger signals. It also helps your pancreas release insulin more efficiently when you eat, improving blood sugar control. The result: you naturally eat less, feel satisfied with smaller portions, and your body handles glucose better.

**Key pathways**:
- GLP-1 receptor activation → slowed gastric emptying (prolonged satiety)
- Hypothalamic GLP-1 receptors → reduced appetite signaling, decreased ghrelin (hunger hormone)
- Pancreatic beta-cell stimulation → glucose-dependent insulin secretion (improves glycemic control)
- Reduced hepatic glucose production → lowers fasting glucose

---

## 5) Protocol Details

**Titration schedule (critical for GI tolerance)**:
- Week 1–2: 0.25 mg SC weekly
- Week 3–4: 0.5 mg SC weekly
- Week 5–6: 1.0 mg SC weekly
- Week 7–8: 1.5 mg SC weekly
- Week 9–10: 2.0 mg SC weekly
- Week 11+: 2.4 mg SC weekly (maintenance; some use 1.5–2.0 mg if tolerated)

**Route**: Subcutaneous injection (abdomen, thigh, upper arm)
**Frequency**: Once weekly (long half-life)
**Duration**: Ongoing until weight goal achieved, then maintain or taper based on clinician guidance

**Adjustment logic**: If severe nausea at any dose, hold dose or reduce by 50%; increase by 0.25–0.5 mg increments every 2–4 weeks; never skip titration steps

---

## 6) Synergy Stack

**Tier 1 - Foundational (NON-NEGOTIABLE)**:
- **Protein**: 1.4–1.6g/lb body weight (CRITICAL for muscle preservation during deficit; appetite suppression makes this challenging; protein shakes essential)
- **Creatine**: 5g daily (strength preservation, muscle fullness)
- **Probiotics**: 50B CFU daily (GI tolerance support; reduce nausea/constipation)
- **Electrolytes**: Sodium + potassium adequate (dehydration risk if nausea/vomiting)
- **Magnesium glycinate**: 400mg before bed (GI motility support, constipation prevention)
- **Fiber**: 25–35g daily from food (constipation prevention; GLP-1 slows gut motility)

**Tier 2 - Goal-specific**:
- **Omega-3**: 2–3g EPA/DHA daily (lipid management, anti-inflammatory)
- **Multivitamin**: Comprehensive micronutrient support (caloric deficit = risk of deficiencies)
- **Ginger or antiemetic**: If nausea severe (ginger tea, B6, prescription antiemetics if needed)

**Avoid combining**: Other GLP-1 agonists (semaglutide, tirzepatide - additive effects; excessive appetite suppression; pancreatitis risk)

---

## 7) Training Protocol Pairing

**Recommended emphasis**: Strength maintenance (priority - prevent muscle loss), Zone 2 cardio (moderate intensity)

**Minimal effective training**:
- Strength: 3–5x/week; compound lifts (squats, deadlifts, bench, rows); 3–4 sets × 8–12 reps; maintain intensity (weight) even if energy lower; adequate rest
- Zone 2 cardio: 2–3x/week; moderate intensity 30–60 min (cycling, elliptical, swimming)
- Avoid: Excessive cardio (>150 min/week high-intensity; catabolic during deficit), training to failure every set (energy lower during deficit)

**Success pattern**: Strength maintained within 5–10% of baseline despite weight loss (if strength dropping >10%, increase protein or reduce deficit)

---

## 8) Contraindications & Warnings

**Absolute**: Personal/family history of MTC, MEN 2, pregnancy, breastfeeding, pancreatitis history, gastroparesis

**Relative**: Diabetic retinopathy (monitor closely; rapid glucose drop can worsen), renal impairment, history of GI disease, concurrent medications with narrow therapeutic index

**Common side effects**: Nausea (60–70%), vomiting (20–30%), constipation (30%), diarrhea (20%), headache, fatigue

**Serious warnings**: Pancreatitis (severe abdominal pain radiating to back = emergency; stop drug immediately), thyroid tumors (theoretical MTC risk; unknown in humans but black box warning on similar drugs), severe hypoglycemia (if combined with insulin/sulfonylureas), diabetic retinopathy worsening (rapid glucose lowering)

**Quality/sourcing safety**: Research-only in many contexts; verify purity, sterility, concentration. FDA has warned about compounded GLP-1 products with contamination, incorrect dosing, lack of sterility.

---

## 9) Monitoring

**Daily/weekly**:
- GI symptoms (nausea 0–10 scale, vomiting episodes, constipation severity) - daily first 8 weeks
- Appetite (0–10 scale) - daily
- Weight (weekly, same time/day)
- Strength logs (maintain baseline within 5–10%)
- Protein intake (track daily; target 1.4–1.6g/lb)

**Monthly**:
- Body composition (DEXA/BodPod ideal; photos/measurements acceptable)
- Strength assessment (lifts maintained?)

**Labs**:
- Baseline: Fasting glucose, HbA1c, lipid panel (total, LDL, HDL, triglycerides), liver/kidney function, thyroid (TSH)
- Month 3: Fasting glucose, HbA1c (if diabetic/pre-diabetic)
- Month 6 & ongoing: Full repeat of baseline panel

---

## 10) Stop/Pause/Escalation Criteria

**Stop immediately if**: Severe abdominal pain (pancreatitis concern), persistent vomiting (dehydration/electrolyte imbalance), allergic reaction, pregnancy, thyroid mass detected

**Pause if**: Intolerable nausea despite slow titration, muscle loss (strength dropping >10%, lean mass decreasing per DEXA), severe constipation not resolving with fiber/magnesium

**Continue if**: Nausea improving (weeks 3–4 typically), weight loss 3–8 lbs/month, strength maintained, GI symptoms manageable, appetite suppression effective

---

## 11) Protocol Variants

**Option B - Performance** (Recommended):
- Cagrilintide (0.25–2.4 mg weekly; slow 12-week titration)
- Protein (1.4–1.6g/lb), Creatine (5g), Probiotics (50B CFU), Magnesium (400mg), Omega-3 (3g)
- Strength 3–5x/week, Zone 2 cardio 2–3x/week
- Weekly weight/GI logs, monthly body comp, Baseline + Month 6 labs

**Option C - Advanced**:
- Cagrilintide (2.4 mg weekly maintenance after titration)
- Full supplement stack + meal planning (pre-calculated high-protein meals to ensure intake)
- Strength 4–5x/week (high priority), Zone 2 cardio 3x/week
- Bi-weekly clinician reviews, Baseline + Month 3 + Month 6 labs, monthly DEXA

---

## 12) Education & Expectations

**What this does**: Reduces appetite via GLP-1 signaling; slows gastric emptying (prolonged fullness); improves insulin sensitivity; supports weight loss in caloric deficit
**What it can't replace**: Caloric deficit (still required for weight loss), adequate protein (1.4–1.6g/lb essential), strength training (prevents muscle loss)
**Realistic timelines**: 2–7 days (appetite reduction, nausea), 4–8 weeks (measurable weight loss 3–8 lbs/month), 3–6 months (significant body composition changes 15–30 lbs fat loss if sustained)

---

## 13) Evidence & Update Log

**Human evidence**: Moderate-strong. RCTs show 10–15% body weight loss over 6–12 months in obesity trials; appetite reduction 50–70%; improved glucose control in T2D; cardiovascular benefits emerging. GLP-1 class well-studied (semaglutide, liraglutide); Cagrilintide-specific data emerging.

**Limitations**: Long-term safety >2 years limited; MTC concern theoretical (rodent data; no definitive human link but caution warranted); muscle loss risk if protocol not optimized; GI side effects limit compliance (~30% discontinue due to nausea); cost/access barriers.

**References**: (GLP-1 class references; Cagrilintide-specific trials emerging in 2023–2025)

**Version**: v2.0.0 (Jan 2025) - Updated to comprehensive protocol template

### 5mg Variant Note

**Cagrilintide 5mg vial** ($90): Lower-dose option for GI-sensitive individuals or those who plateau at lower doses (1.0–1.5 mg weekly). Same protocol; titrate to tolerance. Consider if 10mg vial wasteful (dose <2.4 mg weekly) or if cost-sensitive.

### FRAG 176-191 + AOD 9604 Blend Protocol

**Protocol Card**: FRAG 176-191 + AOD 9604 | Lipolytic Fat Loss | Evidence: C–D | Risk: Low–Moderate

**Quick summary**: HGH fragment blend (FRAG 176-191 + AOD 9604) designed for lipolytic (fat-burning) effects without insulin-like or growth-promoting effects of full GH. Promotes fat oxidation via non-insulin-dependent pathways. Modest fat loss support (1–2 lbs/month additional lipolysis above baseline deficit).

**Mechanism**: FRAG 176-191 is C-terminal fragment of GH (amino acids 176–191) that retains lipolytic activity without metabolic/growth effects; AOD 9604 is modified FRAG variant with enhanced stability. Both stimulate beta-3 adrenergic receptors → hormone-sensitive lipase activation → free fatty acid release from adipose tissue.

**Protocol**: 250–500 mcg SC daily (fasted state preferred - AM before cardio or PM before bed); divide dose if using 500 mcg (250 mcg AM + 250 mcg PM). Duration: 8–12 weeks; assess response at 4 weeks.

**Benefits**: Modest fat loss (1–2 lbs/month above baseline deficit; mechanism-specific lipolysis), body recomposition support (preferential fat oxidation without muscle wasting), no insulin effects (safe for diabetics with monitoring), localized fat reduction (theoretical; limited human validation).

**Best for**: Fat loss phases (adjunct to caloric deficit + training), body recomposition (moderate deficit + strength training), individuals who don't tolerate GLP-1 agonists (no GI side effects), metabolic optimization without appetite suppression.

**Downsides**: Modest effects (not GLP-1-level fat loss; 1–2 lbs/month specific to lipolysis), expensive relative to benefit ($95/vial; need 2–3 vials per cycle = $200–300 for modest effect), limited human data (most evidence animal/mechanistic), individual response highly variable (some see benefit, others minimal).

**Safety**: Well-tolerated; minimal side effects (injection site reactions, mild headache occasionally, possible appetite changes - variable direction); no insulin effects (safer than full GH for diabetics); long-term safety unknown.

**Synergy**: Combine with caloric deficit (300–500 kcal/day), Zone 2 cardio (fasted cardio may enhance lipolysis - theoretical), caffeine (beta-adrenergic synergy - 200–400mg pre-cardio), L-carnitine (fat oxidation support - 1–2g daily), protein 1.2–1.4g/lb (muscle preservation).

**Training pairing**: Zone 2 cardio 3–5x/week (moderate intensity, 30–60 min; fasted AM if tolerated), strength training 3x/week (muscle preservation), avoid excessive high-intensity (catabolic during deficit).

**Monitoring**: Weekly weight (expect 0.5–1.5 lbs/week loss total; FRAG contributes modestly), monthly body comp (DEXA/BodPod - track fat mass specifically), visual changes (photos), energy levels (should not impair energy like aggressive GLP-1 doses).

**Contraindications**: Pregnancy, uncontrolled diabetes (monitor glucose; lipolysis affects energy metabolism), active infection (theoretical immune concern; unclear).

**When to use**: FRAG is a "nice-to-have" adjunct, not essential. Consider if: already optimized diet/training/sleep, willing to invest for marginal benefit (1–2 lbs/month extra lipolysis), don't tolerate GLP-1 agonists (GI intolerance), seeking non-appetite-suppression fat loss support.

**When to skip**: If diet/training not optimized (fix fundamentals first; FRAG won't overcome poor adherence), if budget-limited (GLP-1 agonists provide far greater effect for cost), if expecting dramatic results (effect modest; manage expectations).

**Realistic expectations**: FRAG is complementary, not transformative. In 12-week cycle with proper deficit/training: expect 12–16 lbs total fat loss (from deficit/training); FRAG may add 1.5–3 lbs additional lipolysis (10–20% enhancement). Cost-benefit analysis essential before use.

**Evidence**: Limited. Animal models show lipolytic activity (well-characterized); small human trials suggest modest fat loss (1–2% body fat over 12 weeks); mechanism plausible but effect size small. Evidence grade C–D (mechanistic/animal + limited human observational data).

**Full protocol details** available on request (abbreviated here; secondary priority compound for most users due to modest benefit).
