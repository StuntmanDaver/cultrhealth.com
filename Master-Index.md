## SOURCING & QUALITY NOTES

**All products listed are available from CANLAB INTERNATIONAL only through research suppliers.**

### Key Quality Concerns
1. **Purity**: Verify >95–98% purity certificates
2. **Sterility**: Bacterial/endotoxin testing required
3. **Potency**: Batch variability common in research suppliers
4. **Storage**: Proper refrigeration (2–8°C) essential
5. **Counterfeits**: Common for high-demand products (IGF-1, GLP-1 analogs)

### Recommended Verification Steps
- [ ] Request Certificate of Analysis (CoA)
- [ ] Verify batch/lot numbers
- [ ] Check expiration date (should be >6 months from purchase)
- [ ] Confirm refrigeration upon arrival
- [ ] Take photos of vials (for future reference)
- [ ] Store at 2–8°C (refrigerator, not freezer unless specified)

- [ ] Current medications documented
- [ ] Baseline labs obtained (glucose, liver/kidney function, lipids, blood pressure)
- [ ] Contraindications screened (absolute exclusions noted)
- [ ] Goals clarified (strength, fat loss, recovery, anti-aging, etc.)
- [ ] Training/nutrition plan established
- [ ] Supplement stack designed (supporting nutrients, hydration, sleep)

### Weekly Monitoring Checklist
- [ ] Primary metric tracked (weight, strength, pain, energy, sleep)
- [ ] Side effects logged (severity 0–10 scale)
- [ ] Adherence confirmed (peptide administered as scheduled)
- [ ] Training logged (session completed, effort, recovery)
- [ ] Nutrition logged (protein, calories, hydration)
- [ ] Sleep tracked (hours, quality 0–10)

### Monthly Assessment

### 8-Week Reassessment (Mid-Protocol)
- [ ] Labs (glucose, liver function, lipids if relevant)
- [ ] Progress toward goals (quantified)
- [ ] Dose adjustment decision (maintain, increase, decrease, discontinue)
- [ ] Side effect mitigation (any adjustments needed?)

### 12-Week Post-Protocol Assessment
- [ ] Final labs (repeat baseline panel)
- [ ] Final measurements (body comp, strength, function)
- [ ] Overall outcome assessment (success/partial/minimal benefit)
- [ ] Next steps (continue, change protocol, discontinue)
