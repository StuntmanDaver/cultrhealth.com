---

## 1) Patient Eligibility (Who this is for)

#### Best-fit profile
- **Goal + context**: Athletes or active individuals recovering from tendon/ligament injury (Achilles, rotator cuff, patellar tendon); people with chronic GI inflammation (IBS, leaky gut); post-surgical recovery candidates
- **Training status**: Currently training (modified/rehab) or returning to training after injury
- **History factors**: Responds well to structured rehab protocols; compliant with progressive loading; willing to modify training during healing phase

#### Not recommended / avoid
- **Pregnancy/breastfeeding**: Insufficient safety data
- **Active cancer or recent malignancy**: Growth signaling concern (VEGF/FGF upregulation may theoretically promote tumor growth)
- **Severe kidney/liver disease**: Reduced peptide clearance; safety unknown
- **Untreated systemic infection**: Peptide may potentiate immune response unpredictably

#### When we use caution
- **Cardiovascular risk**: Monitor blood pressure (some animal data suggests transient BP changes)

## 2) Expected Benefits (Ranked)

| Benefit | Who It Helps | Evidence Note | How We Measure It |
|---------|-------------|---------------|-------------------|
| **Tendon/ligament repair** | Athletes, weekend warriors, overhead throwers | C (strong animal data, emerging human case series) | Pain reduction (0–10 scale), ROM improvement (goniometer), return to sport timeline |
| **GI mucosal healing** | IBS, leaky gut, IBD patients | C (animal models + anecdotal human reports) | Symptom diary (bowel frequency, pain, bloating), quality of life scores |
| **Angiogenesis & blood flow** | Poor wound healing, diabetics, surgical recovery | D (animal/mechanistic; limited human) | Wound closure rate, imaging (if available), functional recovery |
| **Neuroprotection** | Nerve compression, spinal injury (preclinical) | D (animal models only) | Subjective neurological symptom improvement |
| **Mild analgesic effect** | Localized pain from injury, chronic tendon pain | C (case-report level) | Pain scale reduction, analgesic medication reduction |

#### Secondary benefits (optional)
- **Improved recovery between training sessions** → Evidence: Anecdotal; athletes report faster bounce-back
- **Joint inflammation reduction** → Evidence: C (mechanism supports, limited human validation)

---

## 3) Downsides / Tradeoffs (Honest)

#### Common drawbacks
- **Limited human data**: Most evidence is animal or retrospective case series; no large RCTs in healthy humans
- **Cost/effort**: $110 per 10mg vial; requires daily or 5x/week injections for 8–12 weeks
- **Results variability**: Individual response varies; some see dramatic benefit, others minimal change

#### What it does NOT do well
- **Myth busting**: NOT a painkiller (works on repair, not acute symptom masking); doesn't cure advanced structural arthritis; won't repair severe tears that require surgery
- **Unrealistic expectations**: Won't work overnight; healing takes weeks to months; requires proper rehab protocol compliance

#### Most common reasons it "doesn't work"
- **Training mismatch**: Continuing high-intensity loading without proper rehab negates repair benefits
- **Sleep deficit**: Inadequate sleep (<7 hours) impairs tissue healing regardless of peptide use
- **Diet nonadherence**: Insufficient protein (<0.8g/lb) or vitamin C limits collagen synthesis
- **Wrong candidate profile**: Advanced structural degeneration (e.g., grade IV arthritis) unlikely to respond
- **Stack interference**: Using NSAIDs chronically may interfere with repair signaling

---

## 4) Mechanism of Action (Simple → Technical)

#### Plain English
BPC-157 acts as a tissue protectant by increasing growth factors (VEGF, FGF) that promote new blood vessel formation and cellular repair. It also reduces inflammation by lowering inflammatory chemicals (IL-6, TNF-α) and stabilizes the gut lining by strengthening tight junctions between cells. Think of it as turning on your body's natural repair machinery while turning down excessive inflammation.

#### Key pathways (for advanced readers)
- **VEGF upregulation**: Promotes angiogenesis (new blood vessel formation), enhancing oxygen and nutrient delivery to injured tissue
- **FGF modulation**: Stimulates fibroblast growth and differentiation, critical for connective tissue remodeling
- **Inflammatory cytokine reduction**: Decreases IL-6 and TNF-α in some models, reducing pro-inflammatory signaling
- **Tight junction stabilization**: Upregulates claudin and zonula occludens proteins in GI epithelium, reducing intestinal permeability
- **eNOS activation**: Enhances endothelial nitric oxide synthase, supporting vascular repair
- **Antioxidant enzyme upregulation**: Increases SOD and catalase, protecting cells from oxidative damage

#### What's uncertain / still emerging
- **Exact receptor mechanism**: No specific BPC-157 receptor identified; mechanism may be pleiotropic (multiple targets)
- **Long-term effects in humans**: Most studies <12 weeks; effects of prolonged use unknown
- **Optimal dosing in humans**: Animal-to-human dose extrapolation not validated in controlled trials
- **Individual variation**: Why some respond dramatically and others minimally remains unclear

---

## 5) The Protocol Itself (Public-Safe)

#### Core compound plan (clinic-guided)
- **Form**: Injectable (subcutaneous), oral (poor bioavailability, not recommended)
- **Schedule style**: Daily or 5–6 days per week
- **Typical duration**: 8–12 weeks (injury-dependent; may extend to 16 weeks for complex cases)
- **Adjustment logic**: Dose adjusted based on pain response, functional improvement, and tolerability; increase if minimal response after 4 weeks; decrease if injection site irritation persists; discontinue if no benefit after 8 weeks or adverse reactions occur

**Public note**: Protocol specifics are individualized by a licensed clinician and may differ based on medical history, injury severity, and goals. BPC-157 is available only through research suppliers or compounding pharmacies; verify purity, sterility, and batch testing.

## 6) Synergy Stack (Make it "Plug-and-Play")

#### Tier 1 — Foundational (almost always)
- **Protein target strategy** (0.8–1.2g/lb body weight): Provides amino acid substrate for collagen synthesis and tissue repair; emphasize collagen peptides for tendon injuries
- **Creatine** (5g daily): Enhances cellular ATP production, supporting energy-dependent repair processes
- **Omega-3** (2–3g EPA/DHA daily): Reduces systemic inflammation, supports membrane fluidity, enhances resolution of inflammatory phase
- **Magnesium glycinate** (300–400mg before bed): Cofactor for >300 enzymatic reactions including collagen synthesis; supports sleep quality critical for recovery
- **Electrolytes/hydration** (adequate sodium/potassium): Maintains cellular function, supports nutrient delivery to injured tissue
- **Sleep anchors** (7–9 hours nightly): Growth hormone release during deep sleep critical for tissue repair; sleep deficit negates peptide benefits

#### Tier 2 — Goal-specific add-ons

**Recovery / tendon**
- **Collagen hydrolysate** (10–15g daily): Direct substrate for tendon/ligament matrix; take with Vitamin C for optimal cross-linking
- **Vitamin C** (1–2g daily with breakfast): Essential cofactor for lysine/proline hydroxylation in collagen synthesis
- **Glycine** (3–5g daily, optional if using collagen): Supports collagen structure; enhances sleep quality
- **Curcumin** (500–1000mg with meals): Reduces systemic inflammation via prostaglandin modulation

**GI healing**
- **L-Glutamine** (5–10g daily): Supports intestinal enterocyte health
- **Probiotics** (multi-strain, 50B CFU): Supports microbiome diversity during gut healing
- **Zinc carnosine** (75mg twice daily): Supports gastric mucosal integrity

#### Tier 3 — Advanced stack (only if indicated)
- **TB-500** (2–4mg SC, 2–3x weekly): Synergistic repair via actin remodeling; adds cost and complexity; only if BPC-157 alone insufficient
- **GHK-Cu** (50–100 mcg SC daily): Copper-dependent collagen synthesis; only if skin/cosmetic goals or systemic repair optimization desired

#### "Avoid combining" (important)
- **Avoid pairing with**: Chronic NSAID use (ibuprofen, naproxen) during repair phase
- **Why**: NSAIDs inhibit prostaglandin-mediated inflammation, which is necessary for initial healing cascade; may blunt BPC-157 repair signaling
- **Avoid pairing with**: Multiple high-dose growth peptides (IGF-1 LR3 + BPC-157 + TB-500 + GHK-Cu all at maximum dose)
- **Why**: Stacked growth signaling increases theoretical cancer risk; cumulative side effects; cost without proven additive benefit

---

## 7) Training Protocol Pairing (How to Make It Work)

#### Recommended emphasis (choose 1–2)
- **Rehab / tendon loading plan** (primary for injury recovery)
- **Deload / recovery phase** (active recovery, reduced training volume)

#### The minimal effective training plan
- **Strength**: 0–2 days/week (modified, pain-free movements only during acute phase); progress to 3–5 days/week as healing permits
- **Zone 2**: 30–45 minutes, 3–5 days/week (low-impact cardio: cycling, swimming, elliptical; maintain cardiovascular fitness without high tendon load)
- **Mobility/rehab**: 15–30 minutes daily (ROM work, eccentric loading 3–5x/week starting week 3–4; progress load tolerance gradually; avoid ballistic movements)

#### What to avoid (most common mistakes)
- **Volume spikes**: Increasing training volume >10% per week during recovery phase (leads to re-injury)
- **Max testing during flare**: Attempting 1RM or max effort lifts while symptomatic (mechanical failure risk)
- **Too much too soon**: Jumping back to pre-injury training volume immediately upon pain reduction (healing lags pain relief)
- **High-intensity plyometrics**: Explosive movements during early healing phase (connective tissue not adapted)

#### Success pattern
- **"Increase training tolerance without symptom flare"**: Gradual progressive loading where pain remains ≤3/10, ROM improves weekly, and functional capacity increases month-over-month

## 8) Contraindications, Warnings, Interactions

#### Absolute contraindications (Do NOT use)
- Active malignancy or cancer treatment (growth signaling concern)
- Severe renal/hepatic dysfunction (reduced clearance, unknown safety)
- Pregnancy or breastfeeding (no human safety data)
- Active untreated systemic infection (unpredictable immune potentiation)
- Known hypersensitivity to BPC-157 (rare but possible)

#### Relative contraindications (Caution)
- Cancer history (unless oncology-cleared; theoretical VEGF/FGF concern)
- Uncontrolled hypertension (monitor BP; some animal data suggests transient changes)
- Autoimmune disease (monitor for flares; inflammatory profile varies individually)
- Bleeding disorders or anticoagulant therapy (VEGF may potentiate bleeding; consult hematologist)
- Severe GI disease requiring active medical management (Crohn's flare, ulcerative colitis exacerbation)

#### Common side effects
- Local injection site irritation (mild erythema, swelling resolves within 1–2 hours)
- Mild GI upset if dosed orally (nausea uncommon with SC route)
- Minimal systemic effects (generally well-tolerated)

#### Serious warnings (seek care)
- Severe injection site reaction (expanding redness, warmth, purulent drainage = infection)
- Unexplained severe abdominal pain (unlikely related but warrants evaluation)
- New onset bleeding or easy bruising (if on anticoagulants)
- Allergic reaction (rash, difficulty breathing, swelling)

#### Interaction considerations
- **Medications**: No major known drug interactions; theoretical concern with anticoagulants (warfarin, heparin) due to angiogenic effects
- **Supplements**: May potentiate other repair peptides (TB-500, GHK-Cu); additive growth signaling
- **Stack complexity warning**: Combining multiple growth-promoting peptides increases theoretical cancer risk and cost without proven safety data

#### Quality + sourcing safety note (critical)
**BPC-157 is only available through unregulated research suppliers or compounding pharmacies.** Quality and dosing variability can significantly increase risk. The FDA has repeatedly warned about unapproved products falsely labeled "for research purposes" being sold for human use without proper oversight, purity testing, or sterility assurance. Verify supplier credentials, request Certificates of Analysis (CoA), and ensure proper refrigeration (2–8°C). Contamination, incorrect dosing, and counterfeit products are real risks.

---

## 9) Monitoring Plan (Symptoms + Optional Labs)

#### Daily/weekly self-tracking
- **Sleep quality** (0–10 scale): Track nightly; healing requires 7–9 hours
- **Appetite changes**: Note any unusual changes (rare with BPC-157)
- **Mood/anxiety**: Monitor baseline; minimal expected impact
- **Resting HR / BP** (if relevant): Weekly check if hypertension history
- **GI symptoms**: Daily log if using for GI healing (bowel frequency, pain, bloating)
- **Training tolerance**: Rate workout quality, soreness, recovery speed
- **Pain level** (0–10 scale): Track daily; expect gradual reduction over weeks
- **ROM improvement**: Measure weekly (goniometer ideal; visual acceptable)
- **Injection site reaction**: Note any redness, swelling, warmth after each injection
- **Any unusual symptoms**: Headache, dizziness, allergic signs

#### Clinician check-ins
- **Week 1–2**: Check injection technique, tolerance, initial response; adjust if severe site reactions
- **Week 4**: Evaluate functional progress (pain reduction, ROM improvement); continue if positive trend; consider dose adjustment if minimal response
- **Week 8–12**: Reassess need for continuation; taper if functional goals met; cycle off if no clear benefit; consider extending to week 16 for complex injuries

#### Optional labs (only if meaningful for this compound)
- **Inflammatory markers** (IL-6, CRP): Pre/post comparison if available (not required; expensive and variability high)
- **Liver/kidney function**: Baseline if history of disease; repeat at week 8–12 if prolonged use
- **Imaging** (MRI, ultrasound): Structural assessment of tendon healing (gold standard but costly; reserve for severe injuries)

---

## 10) Stop / Pause / Escalation Criteria (Safety Rules)

#### Stop immediately and contact clinician if:
- **Severe injection site infection** (expanding redness, fever, purulent drainage)
- **Allergic reaction** (rash, hives, difficulty breathing, facial swelling)
- **Unexplained severe pain** (unrelated to injury site; could indicate unrelated emergency)
- **New onset bleeding** (if on anticoagulants; unusual bruising, blood in stool/urine)

#### Pause and reassess if:
- **Injection site reactions persist beyond 24 hours** (mild irritation normal <2 hours; prolonged = potential contamination or sensitivity)
- **No functional improvement after 8 weeks** (consider alternative diagnosis, imaging, or discontinuation)
- **GI symptoms worsen** (if using for GI healing; possible unrelated flare requiring medical evaluation)
- **New symptoms emerge** (unrelated to expected mechanism; could be coincidental illness)

#### Continue if:
- **Pain trending downward** (even if slow; 10–20% reduction per month acceptable)
- **ROM improving weekly** (measurable gains each week)
- **Functional capacity increasing** (able to progress rehab exercises without pain flare)
- **Tolerating injections well** (minimal site reactions, no systemic symptoms)

---

---

## 12) Education & Expectations (What patients should know)

#### What this is meant to do
- Accelerate tissue repair by upregulating growth factors and reducing excessive inflammation
- Support tendon/ligament healing in conjunction with proper rehab (not a replacement for rehab)
- Optimize GI mucosal healing for chronic inflammatory GI conditions (supportive, not curative)

#### What it can't replace
- **Sleep**: Healing requires 7–9 hours nightly; peptide ineffective if sleep-deprived
- **Training consistency**: Proper progressive rehab is mandatory; peptide won't heal tissue if you continue to injure it
- **Nutrition fundamentals**: Adequate protein (0.8–1.2g/lb), Vitamin C, hydration essential for collagen synthesis
- **Rehab progression**: Structured eccentric loading, gradual return to sport; peptide accelerates healing but doesn't bypass mechanical adaptation

#### Realistic timelines
- **Early changes** (days–2 weeks): Subjective pain reduction, improved GI symptoms, better sleep quality (indirect recovery marker)
- **Meaningful changes** (4–8+ weeks): Measurable ROM improvement, functional capacity increase, return to modified training
- **Full structural healing** (8–16+ weeks): Complete tendon remodeling, return to pre-injury performance level (imaging-confirmed if severe)

---

## 13) Evidence & Update Log (Timeless credibility)

#### Evidence snapshot
- **Human evidence**: Limited. Case series and anecdotal reports suggest benefit in tendon injury (Achilles, rotator cuff, patellar tendon) and GI healing (IBS, leaky gut). One small open-label trial in wound healing (positive). No published large RCTs in humans. Evidence grade C (observational/case series level).
- **Preclinical evidence**: Robust and consistent. Multiple rodent/animal models show VEGF upregulation, accelerated wound healing, enhanced bone/tendon repair, neuroprotection post-spinal injury, GI mucosal restoration. Mechanism well-characterized in vitro.
- **Major limitations**: Small sample sizes in human studies; most evidence is mechanistic or retrospective; long-term safety unknown (most animal studies <12 weeks); purity/dosing variability in research suppliers significant; individual variation in response; no blinded placebo-controlled human trials; unknown interactions with other peptides/medications

#### SECTION 1 — WHAT IT IS (60 seconds)
BPC-157 is a 15-amino acid peptide derived from gastric juice that acts as a broad-spectrum tissue protectant. Originally isolated to support GI healing, preclinical research suggests it promotes tendon, ligament, and muscle recovery through growth factor upregulation and angiogenesis. Clinically, it's used off-label (via compounding or research suppliers) for musculoskeletal injury recovery and GI support. **Key insight**: Strong preclinical evidence; emerging clinical case series; mechanism well-characterized. Who it helps most: active individuals with tendon/ligament strain, people recovering from injury, those with chronic GI inflammation. **Not** a pain killer—it works on repair, not acute symptom relief.

#### SECTION 2 — BENEFITS (ranked)

| Benefit | Who It Helps | Evidence |
|---------|-------------|----------|
| **Tendon/ligament repair** | Athletes, weekend warriors, overhead throwers, gymnasts | C (strong animal data, emerging human case series) |
| **GI mucosal healing** | IBS, leaky gut, IBD (supportive only), chronic diarrhea | C (animal models + anecdotal; not a cure) |
| **Angiogenesis & blood flow** | Poor wound healing, diabetics, surgical recovery | D (animal/mechanistic; limited human) |
| **Neuroprotection** | Spinal cord injury (preclinical focus), nerve compression | D (animal models) |
| **Mild analgesic effect** | Localized pain from injury, chronic tendon pain | C (case-report level; mild) |

**What results look like:** Reduced pain with tendon loading within 2–4 weeks; improved ROM by week 4–6; faster return to sport/training (2–4 weeks faster than controls, anecdotal); normalized GI symptoms if baseline GI compromise; better recovery between sessions.

#### SECTION 3 — DOWNSIDES / CONS
- **Limited human data:** Most evidence is animal or retrospective case series. No large RCTs in healthy humans. Mechanism inferred rather than proven.
- **Common side effects:** Local injection site irritation (mild, 1–2 mm erythema), GI nausea if dosed orally (uncommon with SC use), minimal systemic effects.
- **Failure modes:** Doesn't work if you continue high-intensity loading without proper rehab; requires compliance with gentle rehab protocol; won't repair severe structural tears without surgery.
- **Most frequent reasons to stop:** Minimal—usually continued until benefit plateaus (4–12 weeks); some discontinue due to cost or lack of perceived effect.

#### SECTION 4 — MECHANISMS & PATHWAYS
- **Primary pathways:** VEGF upregulation (angiogenesis), FGF modulation (growth, differentiation), reduction of inflammatory cytokines (IL-6 ↓, TNF-α ↓), stabilization of tight junctions in GI epithelium via claudin/zonula occludens modulation.
- **Upregulates:** VEGF, FGF, eNOS (endothelial nitric oxide synthase, vascular repair), HGF (hepatocyte growth factor, tissue remodeling), antioxidant enzymes (SOD, catalase).
- **Downregulates:** Pro-inflammatory IL-6, TNF-α (in some models), inflammatory macrophage infiltration.
- **Does NOT:** Stimulate muscle growth directly (secondary to repair), cure advanced arthritis (structural degeneration), act as a painkiller (indirect pain reduction via healing).

#### SECTION 5 — BEST SYNERGIES

| Category | Pairing | Why | Risk Note |
|----------|---------|-----|-----------|
| **Repair & recovery** | TB-500, GHK-Cu, Collagen peptides (10–15g daily) | Complementary angiogenesis + matrix deposition + actin remodeling | Additive growth signaling—monitor if cancer history; synergistic |
| **Tendon/joint support** | Vitamin C (1–2g daily with breakfast), Magnesium glycinate (300–400mg PM) | Collagen cross-linking cofactors; lysine/proline hydroxylation requires Vitamin C | None; well-tolerated combination |
| **Anti-inflammation** | Omega-3 (2–3g EPA/DHA daily), Curcumin (500–1000mg with meals) | Systemic inflammatory modulation; reduce prostaglandin-mediated inflammation | None; synergistic anti-inflammatory |
| **Sleep/recovery** | Magnesium glycinate, Glycine (3–5g daily, optional if collagen used), Taurine (2–3g daily) | Enhanced protein synthesis, HPA axis downregulation, sleep quality | None; all support repair |
| **Metabolic support** | Creatine monohydrate (5g daily), Whey protein (1–1.2g/lb) | Improved ATP/cellular energy for repair; substrate for muscle remodeling | None; foundational |

**Do NOT combine:** Multiple high-dose growth peptides (IGF-1 LR3 + BPC-157 + TB-500 + GHK-Cu all at high dose) without clinical oversight due to stacked growth signaling risk and unpredictable interactions.

#### SECTION 6 — WORKOUT PROTOCOL PAIRING
- **Recommended training emphasis:** Rehab / tendon loading plan (primary), Deload / recovery phase, Mobility/ROM work
- **What to prioritize:** Controlled eccentric loading (3–5x/week, pain-free), ROM mobility work (daily), pain-free movement patterns, avoid high-velocity/ballistic loading, progressive loading tolerance
- **What to avoid:** High-intensity plyometrics, heavy compound lifts (during acute phase), sprinting while injured, aggressively pushing through pain (healing requires rest)
- **Minimum effective training dose:** 15–30 min mobility/rehab + 30–45 min Zone 2 cardio (low-impact), 4–5x/week; active recovery on off-days (light walking, stretching)

#### SECTION 7 — SUPPLEMENT STACK PAIRING

**Foundational support:**
- **Protein:** 0.8–1.2g/lb body weight (repair substrate; emphasize collagen peptides)
- **Magnesium glycinate:** 300–400mg before bed (neuromuscular recovery, sleep quality, tendon health)
- **Omega-3:** 2–3g EPA/DHA daily (anti-inflammatory, membrane fluidity)
- **Vitamin C:** 500–1000mg with breakfast (collagen synthesis cofactor, antioxidant)
- **Electrolytes:** Sodium/potassium/magnesium during Zone 2 training (hydration optimization)

**Goal-specific add-ons (joints/tendon repair):**
- **Collagen hydrolysate:** 10–15g daily (type I/III collagen for tendons; mix into beverages)
- **Glycine:** 3–5g daily (optional if taking collagen; redundant but synergistic)
- **Curcumin:** 500–1000mg with meals (anti-inflammatory, reduces systemic inflammation)
- **Gelatin (alternative to hydrolyzed collagen):** 10g daily (collagen-rich, pre-gelatin gelatin)
- **Zinc:** 15–30mg daily (collagen cross-linking, immune support during healing)

#### SECTION 8 — CONTRAINDICATIONS & WARNINGS

**Absolute contraindications:**
- Active malignancy or cancer history (unless clinician-supervised; growth signaling concern with VEGF/FGF upregulation)
- Severe renal/hepatic dysfunction (reduced clearance, safety unknown)
- Active systemic infection (peptide may potentiate immune response unpredictably)

**Relative contraindications:**
- Pregnancy/breastfeeding (insufficient safety data; avoid)
- Uncontrolled blood pressure (monitor; some animal data suggests transient BP changes)
- Autoimmune disease (use with caution; inflammatory profile individual; monitor for flares)
- Bleeding disorders or anticoagulant use (VEGF/angiogenesis may potentiate bleeding—consult clinician)

**Quality/sourcing warning:** BPC-157 is only available through unregulated research suppliers or compounding pharmacies. Verify purity (>98%), sterility (bacterial/endotoxin testing), and batch testing. Contamination or incorrect dosing is a real risk from unreliable suppliers. Cost: $110–150/vial.

#### SECTION 9 — DOSING & ADMINISTRATION
- **Typical clinical range:** 250–500 mcg injected subcutaneously, daily or 5x/week (varies widely by protocol; no consensus standard)
- **Frequency:** Daily or 5–6 days/week for 8–12 weeks, then taper or discontinue based on response
- **Route:** Subcutaneous injection (abdomen, thigh); oral bioavailability is poor (peptide degraded in stomach)
- **Timing:** Flexible; not time-dependent
- **Individualization:** Dose adjusted by clinician based on injury severity, patient tolerance, response; start conservative (250 mcg) and titrate if needed

#### SECTION 10 — MONITORING & LABS

**Self-monitoring:**
- **Injection site reaction:** Redness, swelling, warmth (should resolve within 1–2 hours)
- **Pain level during rehab:** 0–10 scale, track weekly (expect gradual decrease)
- **ROM improvement:** Measure weekly (goniometer ideal; visual assessment acceptable)
- **GI symptoms if baseline GI issues:** Nausea, diarrhea, constipation (should improve)
- **Appetite, energy, mood:** Indirect recovery markers

**Optional labs:**
- **Inflammatory markers** (IL-6, CRP) pre/post if available—not required but helpful
- **Liver/kidney function** at baseline if history of disease (assess peptide clearance safety)

#### SECTION 11 — EVIDENCE & CITATIONS

**Human evidence summary:** Limited. Case series and anecdotal reports suggest benefit in tendon injury (Achilles, rotator cuff, patellar tendon) and GI healing (IBS, leaky gut). One small open-label trial in wound healing (positive). No published large RCTs in humans. Evidence grade is C (observational/case series level), not A–B.

**Animal evidence summary:** Robust and consistent. Multiple rodent/animal models show VEGF upregulation, accelerated wound healing, enhanced bone/tendon repair, neuroprotection post-spinal injury, GI mucosal restoration. Mechanism well-characterized in vitro.

**Key limitations:** Small sample sizes in human studies; most evidence is mechanistic or retrospective; long-term safety unknown (most animal studies <12 weeks); purity/dosing variability in research suppliers significant; individual variation in response; no blinded placebo-controlled human trials.

**Change log:**
- v1.1 (Jan 2025): Added GI mechanism detail, anticoagulant caution, cost note.
- v1.0 (Jan 2025): Initial template application. Evidence grade C assigned based on animal data + emerging case series.

## Key Details (Full Protocol)

### Mechanism
**Plain English**: TB-500 is a fragment of Thymosin Beta-4, a protein that regulates actin (a building block of muscle and cellular structure). It promotes cell migration to injury sites, reduces inflammation, and supports new blood vessel formation (angiogenesis). Think of it as a cellular "repair signal" that helps damaged tissue reorganize and heal faster.

**Key pathways**:
- **Actin sequestration**: Binds G-actin, promotes cell migration and tissue remodeling
- **Angiogenesis**: Upregulates VEGF, promotes new blood vessel formation to injured areas
- **Inflammation reduction**: Downregulates inflammatory cytokines (IL-6, TNF-α in some models)
- **Stem cell differentiation**: May promote satellite cell activation (muscle progenitor cells)

### Protocol Details

**Dosing**:
- **Loading phase**: 2–4 mg SC, 2–3x weekly for 4–6 weeks
- **Maintenance phase**: 2–4 mg SC, once weekly (or as needed for flare-ups)
- **Route**: Subcutaneous injection (abdomen, thigh)

**Duration**: 4–12 weeks depending on injury severity; loading phase essential for initial tissue repair

**Adjustment logic**: Start at 2 mg 2x/week; increase to 4 mg if minimal response after 2–3 weeks; reduce frequency to weekly once acute inflammation resolves; cycle off once functional recovery achieved

### Benefits (Ranked)

| Benefit | Evidence | How We Measure |
|---------|----------|----------------|
| **Muscle strain recovery** | C–D (Animal data; anecdotal human) | Pain reduction, ROM, return to training timeline |
| **Inflammation reduction** | C (Mechanistic; animal models) | Subjective inflammation assessment, CRP (if tracked) |
| **Soft tissue repair** | C–D (Animal models positive) | Functional recovery, imaging (if severe injury) |
| **ROM improvement** | C (Anecdotal; case series) | Goniometer measurement weekly |

### Downsides

- **Cost**: $120 per vial; typically need 3–6 vials for loading phase ($360–720 per cycle)
- **Injection frequency**: 2–3x weekly (compliance challenging)
- **Limited human data**: Most evidence from animal models; human trials sparse
- **Results variability**: Individual response varies; some see dramatic benefit, others minimal

### Synergy Stack

**Tier 1 - Foundational**:
- BPC-157 (250–500 mcg daily - synergistic repair; often combined with TB-500)
- Collagen peptides (10–15g daily)
- Vitamin C (1–2g daily)
- Omega-3 (2–3g EPA/DHA daily)
- Magnesium (400mg before bed)

**Tier 2 - Goal-specific**:
- GHK-Cu (50–100 mcg daily - collagen synthesis)
- Curcumin (500–1000mg - anti-inflammatory)
- Glycine (3–5g daily - connective tissue support)

**Avoid combining**: Multiple high-dose growth peptides without clinical oversight (cumulative growth signaling risk)

### Training Pairing

- **Recommended emphasis**: Rehab/recovery phase, gradual return to activity, mobility work
- **What to prioritize**: Pain-free movement, progressive loading, ROM restoration
- **What to avoid**: High-intensity training during acute phase, training through pain
- **Minimum effective dose**: 15–30 min mobility daily, Zone 2 cardio 3–5x/week (low-impact)

### Contraindications & Warnings

**Absolute**: Active cancer, active infection, pregnancy
**Relative**: Cancer history (monitor), autoimmune disease (caution), bleeding disorders

**Common side effects**: Injection site reactions, headaches (rare), fatigue (transient)

**Serious warnings**: Growth signaling concern (VEGF upregulation may theoretically promote tumor growth)

**Quality/sourcing note**: Research-only compound; verify purity (>95%), sterility, batch testing. Counterfeit products common.

### Monitoring

**Daily/weekly**: Pain (0–10 scale), ROM measurement, injection site reactions, training tolerance
**Labs**: Optional - inflammatory markers (CRP, IL-6) baseline/post if available; not required
**Imaging**: MRI/ultrasound if severe injury warrants structural assessment

### Stop/Pause/Escalation Criteria

**Stop if**: Severe infection at injection site, allergic reaction, no improvement after 8 weeks, new symptoms unrelated to injury
**Pause if**: Injection site reactions persist >24 hours, mild side effects persist beyond 4 weeks
**Continue if**: Pain/inflammation reducing, ROM improving, functional capacity increasing, tolerating injections well

### Protocol Variants

**Option B - Performance** (Recommended):
