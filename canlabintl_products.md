#### SECTION 1 — WHAT IT IS (60 seconds)
BPC-157 is a 15-amino acid peptide derived from gastric juice that acts as a broad-spectrum tissue protectant. Originally isolated to support GI healing, preclinical research suggests it promotes tendon, ligament, and muscle recovery through growth factor upregulation and angiogenesis. Clinically, it's used off-label (via compounding or research suppliers) for musculoskeletal injury recovery and GI support. Who it helps most: active individuals with tendon/ligament strain, people recovering from injury, those with chronic GI inflammation. **Not** a pain killer—it works on repair, not acute symptom relief.

#### SECTION 2 — BENEFITS (ranked)

| Benefit | Who It Helps | Evidence |
|---------|-------------|----------|
| **Tendon/ligament repair** | Athletes, weekend warriors, overhead throwers | C (strong animal data, emerging human case series) |
| **GI mucosal healing** | IBS, leaky gut, IBD (supportive only) | C (animal models + anecdotal) |
| **Angiogenesis & blood flow** | Poor wound healing, diabetics | D (animal/mechanistic) |
| **Neuroprotection** | Spinal cord injury (preclinical focus) | D (animal) |
| **Mild analgesic effect** | Localized pain from injury | C (case-report level) |

**What results look like:** Reduced pain with tendon loading within 2–4 weeks; improved ROM; faster return to sport/training; normalized GI symptoms (if baseline GI compromise).

#### SECTION 3 — DOWNSIDES / CONS
- **Limited human data:** Most evidence is animal or retrospective case series. No large RCTs.
- **Common side effects:** Local injection site irritation (mild), GI nausea if dosed orally (uncommon).
- **Failure modes:** Doesn't work if you continue high-intensity loading without proper rehab; requires compliance with gentle rehab protocol.
- **Most frequent reasons to stop:** Minimal—usually continued until benefit plateaus (4–12 weeks).

#### SECTION 4 — MECHANISMS & PATHWAYS
- **Primary pathways:** VEGF upregulation (angiogenesis), FGF modulation (growth), reduction of inflammatory cytokines (IL-6, TNF-α), stabilization of tight junctions in GI epithelium.
- **Upregulates:** VEGF, FGF, eNOS (endothelial repair), antioxidant enzymes.
- **Downregulates:** Pro-inflammatory IL-6, TNF-α (in some models).
- **Does NOT:** Stimulate muscle growth directly, cure advanced arthritis, act as a painkiller.

#### SECTION 5 — BEST SYNERGIES

| Category | Pairing | Why | Risk Note |
|----------|---------|-----|-----------|
| **Repair & recovery** | TB-500, GHK-Cu, Collagen peptides | Complementary angiogenesis + matrix deposition | Additive growth signaling—monitor if cancer history |
| **Tendon/joint support** | Vitamin C (1–2g daily), Magnesium glycinate | Collagen cross-linking cofactors | None |
| **Anti-inflammation** | Omega-3 (2–3g EPA/DHA), Curcumin | Systemic inflammatory modulation | None |
| **Sleep/recovery** | Magnesium glycinate, Glycine, Taurine | Enhanced protein synthesis, HPA axis support | None |
| **Metabolic support** | Creatine monohydrate (5g daily) | Improved ATP/cellular energy for repair | None |

**Do NOT combine:** Multiple high-dose growth peptides (IGF-1 LR3 + BPC-157 + TB-500) without clinical oversight due to stacked growth signaling risk.

#### SECTION 6 — WORKOUT PROTOCOL PAIRING

#### SECTION 1 — WHAT IT IS (60 seconds)
IGF-1 LR3 is a modified variant of insulin-like growth factor 1 that has extended half-life (several days vs. minutes for native IGF-1). It activates growth pathways critical for muscle protein synthesis, strength, and metabolic health. Clinically, it's used investigationally in GH-deficiency states and off-label by performance athletes. Who it helps: strength athletes, muscle-building goals, metabolic recovery. **Not** a replacement for adequate training or nutrition; amplifies results only if training stimulus is present.

#### SECTION 2 — BENEFITS (ranked)

| Benefit | Who It Helps | Evidence |
|---------|-------------|----------|
| **Lean muscle gain** | Athletes, hypertrophy-focused trainees | B–C (RCTs in deficient populations, anecdotal in healthy athletes) |
| **Strength improvement** | Strength athletes, powerlifters | B–C (training-dependent) |
| **Metabolic flexibility** | Endurance athletes, fat-loss phases | D (mechanistic; human data limited) |
| **Joint recovery** | Joint-stressed athletes (cautiously) | C–D (animal data positive; human risk/benefit unclear) |
| **Insulin sensitivity** | Metabolic optimization (paradoxically can impair if abused) | D (mechanistic) |

**What results look like:** 5–15 lbs lean mass gain in 8–12 weeks (with training); 10–20% strength increase; improved body composition (with adequate protein + training); improved workout recovery.

#### SECTION 3 — DOWNSIDES / CONS
- **High side-effect burden:** Hypoglycemia, joint pain, carpal tunnel, fluid retention, headache.
- **Growth signaling risk:** Not appropriate for cancer survivors without oncology clearance.
- **Requires expertise:** Needs proper nutrition (high carbs + protein), glucose monitoring, training progression.
- **Failure modes:** Hypoglycemia if diet inadequate; overtraining injury if joints unprepared; strength gain outpaces connective tissue adaptation.
- **Frequent reasons to stop:** Joint pain, blood glucose dysregulation, cost, ethical/sporting concerns.

#### SECTION 4 — MECHANISMS & PATHWAYS
- **Primary pathways:** IGF-1 receptor activation → mTOR pathway upregulation → protein synthesis ↑↑, protein breakdown ↓, myofibrillar growth, glucose uptake ↑.
- **Upregulates:** mTOR, PI3K/Akt (protein synthesis), GLUT4 (glucose uptake), IGF-binding proteins.
- **Downregulates:** Myostatin (inhibitor of muscle growth).
- **Does NOT:** Directly increase testosterone; cause joint inflammation (though rapid strength gain stresses joints mechanically).

#### SECTION 5 — BEST SYNERGIES

| Category | Pairing | Why | Risk Note |
|----------|---------|-----|-----------|
| **Anabolic synergy** | Testosterone (if male), GH | Complementary growth pathways; powerful but high complexity | **Higher risk:** stacked growth signaling, needs labs/monitoring |
| **Metabolic support** | Carbohydrate (4–6g/kg daily), Protein (1.2–1.8g/lb) | Fuel for muscle building, prevents hypoglycemia | **Essential:** Poor carb intake risks dangerous hypoglycemia |
| **Strength/recovery** | Creatine (5g/day), Beta-alanine | Cellular energy, muscle endurance | None |
| **Micronutrient support** | Magnesium, Potassium, Sodium, Zinc | Mineral loss with high-volume training | None |

#### SECTION 1 — WHAT IT IS (60 seconds)
ACE-031 is a myostatin inhibitor that blocks activin A signaling, preventing the natural muscle-wasting cascade. In preclinical models and early human trials, it promotes lean muscle mass gain while sparing fat, making it attractive for fat-loss phases and catabolic states. Unlike traditional anabolics, ACE-031 doesn't increase mass indiscriminately—it preferentially preserves muscle. Who it helps: athletes cutting fat, elderly experiencing sarcopenia, people recovering from illness. **Not** a standalone muscle-builder; works best with training stimulus and adequate protein.

#### SECTION 2 — BENEFITS (ranked)

| Benefit | Who It Helps | Evidence |
|---------|-------------|----------|
| **Muscle preservation during deficit** | Athletes cutting, caloric restriction | B–C (early human trials, strong animal data) |
| **Lean mass gain** | Strength athletes, sarcopenia prevention | B–C (animal models, emerging human) |
| **Fat-sparing effect** | Fat-loss phases (preferential lean preservation) | B (animal + mechanistic) |
| **Strength maintenance** | Aging, catabolic states | C (early human reports) |
| **Improved body composition** | Overall physique improvement | C (limited human data) |

**What results look like:** 3–8 lbs lean mass gain in 8–12 weeks; improved muscle/fat ratio; maintained or increased strength during caloric deficit; reduced metabolic adaptation.

#### SECTION 3 — DOWNSIDES / CONS
- **Very limited human data:** Only early trials; long-term safety unknown.
- **Common side effects:** Injection site irritation, occasional joint discomfort (mechanical from rapid adaptation), mild elevation of liver enzymes.
- **Failure modes:** Doesn't work without adequate protein/training; requires progressive overload.
- **Frequent reasons to stop:** Cost, uncertainty of long-term safety, regulatory concerns.

#### SECTION 4 — MECHANISMS & PATHWAYS
- **Primary pathways:** Activin A/B blockade → myostatin inhibition → reduced protein breakdown, enhanced protein synthesis via Smad pathway suppression.
- **Upregulates:** Muscle protein synthesis, anabolic signaling (PI3K/mTOR).
- **Downregulates:** Myostatin, activin A pro-catabolic signaling.
- **Does NOT:** Increase cortisol or suppress immune function (unlike some anabolics).

#### SECTION 5 — BEST SYNERGIES

#### SECTION 1 — WHAT IT IS (60 seconds)
ARA-290 is an EPO-receptor agonist designed to mimic erythropoietin signaling without the hematopoietic harms of classic EPO (like polycythemia). It increases red blood cell production, improving oxygen delivery and endurance. Originally developed for neuroprotection in neuropathy trials. Who it helps: endurance athletes, altitude trainers, people recovering from tissue injury. **Not** for people with clotting risk or uncontrolled hypertension; carries thrombosis concern if hematocrit becomes excessive.

#### SECTION 2 — BENEFITS (ranked)

| Benefit | Who It Helps | Evidence |
|---------|-------------|----------|
| **VO2max improvement** | Endurance athletes, cyclists, runners | B–C (human trials, strong mechanistic) |
| **Red blood cell production** | Hypoxic/high-altitude environments | B (controlled human studies) |
| **Endurance capacity** | Zone 2 athletes, long-distance performers | B–C (training-dependent) |
| **Neuroprotection** | Diabetes neuropathy, peripheral nerve injury | B (clinical trial data) |
| **Tissue repair & oxygenation** | Recovery from injury, poor circulation | D (mechanistic) |

**What results look like:** 3–8% VO2max improvement in 4–8 weeks; 10–15% endurance capacity gain; faster recovery in endurance training; improved high-altitude adaptation.

#### SECTION 3 — DOWNSIDES / CONS
- **Thrombosis risk:** Elevated hematocrit increases clotting risk (especially above 50–55%).
- **Common side effects:** Mild headache, fatigue (from RBC shift), joint pain, myalgia.
- **Failure modes:** Doesn't enhance sprint/power (endurance-specific); thrombosis if hematocrit unmonitored.
- **Frequent reasons to stop:** Clotting concerns, regulatory issues, excessive hematocrit, cost.

#### SECTION 4 — MECHANISMS & PATHWAYS
- **Primary pathways:** EPO receptor activation (non-hematopoietic isoform) → Jak/Stat signaling → RBC proliferation, neuroprotection (STAT3, PI3K upregulation).
- **Upregulates:** Hematopoiesis, HIF-1α (hypoxia response), neurotropic factors (GDNF, VEGF).
- **Downregulates:** Apoptosis in neuronal cells.
- **Does NOT:** Increase testosterone or directly improve power output.

---

#### SECTION 1 — WHAT IT IS (60 seconds)
Cagrilintide is a GLP-1 receptor agonist designed to reduce appetite and support weight loss via improved metabolic signaling. Similar mechanism to semaglutide/ozempic but distinct formulation. Slows gastric emptying, increases satiety signaling, improves glucose control. Who it helps: weight loss-focused individuals, metabolic syndrome, T2D support. **Not** a magic pill—requires adequate protein + training to preserve muscle during deficit.

#### SECTION 2 — BENEFITS (ranked)

| Benefit | Who It Helps | Evidence |
|---------|-------------|----------|
| **Appetite suppression** | Overweight, obesity, binge eaters | B (strong human trial data) |
| **Weight loss** | Metabolic health, body composition | B (RCT data) |

**What results look like:** 3–8 lbs/month weight loss (with adequate deficit); appetite reduction 50–70% (subjective); stable blood glucose; improved energy (after adaptation).

#### SECTION 3 — DOWNSIDES / CONS
- **Significant GI side effects:** Nausea, vomiting, constipation very common initially; can be severe (some users unable to tolerate).
- **Muscle loss risk:** Aggressive caloric deficit + GLP-1 can cause lean mass loss if protein/training inadequate.
- **Slow titration required:** Must escalate dose over weeks to minimize nausea; fast titration causes severe GI upset.
- **Pancreatitis concern:** Rare but serious; monitor for severe abdominal pain.
- **Frequent reasons to stop:** Intolerable GI side effects, nausea not improving, cost, muscle loss concern.

#### SECTION 4 — MECHANISMS & PATHWAYS
- **Primary pathway:** GLP-1 receptor activation → slowed gastric emptying, increased satiety hormones (GLP-1 acts on brain satiety centers), improved glucose-dependent insulin secretion.
- **Upregulates:** GLP-1 signaling, satiety, insulin secretion.
- **Downregulates:** Ghrelin (hunger hormone), appetite drive.
- **Does NOT:** Increase metabolic rate directly (weight loss from appetite reduction + modest thermic effect).
