# Bioregulators & Neuropeptides

## Overview

Bioregulators are peptides that influence systemic regulatory functions: immune support, sleep optimization, cognitive enhancement, and anti-aging mechanisms. These compounds often work through neuroendocrine pathways.

## Quick Reference

| Product | Size | Evidence | Risk | Best For |
|---------|------|----------|------|----------|
| Epitalon | 10mg | C-D | Low-Moderate | Telomerase activation |
| DSIP | 5mg | C-D | Low | Sleep quality |
| Thymosin-α1 | 4.5mg | B-C | Low | Immune support |
| SEMAX | 10mg | C-D | Low | Cognitive enhancement |
| SELANK | 10mg | C-D | Low | Anxiety reduction |

## Key Compounds

### Epitalon (Epithalon)
**Mechanism**: Stimulates telomerase and improves pineal gland function; anti-aging peptide

**Dosage**: 5-10mg before bed (10-day cycles)
**Route**: Subcutaneous or Intranasal
**Duration**: 10-20 days on, 20 days off
**Expected Effects**: Improved sleep, reduced inflammation, potential lifespan effects

### DSIP (Delta Sleep-Inducing Peptide)
**Mechanism**: Promotes slow-wave sleep and sleep quality without sedation

**Dosage**: 100-500mcg at bedtime
**Route**: Intranasal, Intravenous, or Subcutaneous
**Duration**: 4-12 weeks
**Best For**: Sleep optimization, recovery enhancement

### Thymosin Alpha-1
**Mechanism**: Immune peptide that upregulates T-cell production and immune surveillance

**Dosage**: 1.6-4.5mg 2-3x weekly
**Route**: Subcutaneous or Intramuscular
**Duration**: 4-16 weeks (can be ongoing)
**Uses**: Immune support, general health maintenance

### SEMAX & SELANK
**Mechanism**: Nootropic peptides that enhance cognitive function and reduce anxiety through ACTH derivatives

**SEMAX Dosage**: 200-600mcg daily (intranasal)
**SELANK Dosage**: 250-500mcg daily (intranasal)
**Duration**: 4-8 weeks per cycle
**Best For**: Cognitive performance, mood support

## Optimal Timing Guide

| Product | Optimal Timing | Category | Notes |
|---------|---------------|----------|-------|
| Epitalon | Before bed | Evening/Pre-Sleep | Pineal/circadian support; 10-day cycles |
| DSIP | 30-60 min before bed | Evening/Pre-Sleep | Delta sleep induction; must be dosed before sleep |
| Thymosin-α1 | Morning | Morning | Immune support; consistent AM dosing optimal |
| SEMAX | Morning or early afternoon | Morning | Cognitive enhancement; avoid late PM (may affect sleep) |
| SELANK | Morning or as needed | Morning/Flexible | Anxiolytic; avoid late evening if sleep-sensitive |
| NAD+ | Morning | Morning | Cellular energy; supports daytime metabolism |
| MOTS-c | Morning or pre-workout | Morning/Pre-Workout | Metabolic/exercise support |
| PT-141 | 30-60 min before desired effect | Flexible/Situational | Sexual function; situational dosing |
| Kisspeptin-10 | 30-60 min before desired effect | Flexible/Situational | GnRH trigger; situational use |

**Key Rules**:
- **Sleep peptides (DSIP)**: 30-60 minutes before bed; do not combine with other sedatives
- **Cognitive peptides (SEMAX, SELANK)**: Morning/early day; avoid late afternoon to prevent sleep disruption
- **Immune peptides (Thymosin-α1)**: Morning consistency; supports daily immune rhythm

## Comprehensive Protocols

### Anti-Aging Stack (12+ weeks, cycled)
- Epitalon: 5-10mg before bed (10-day cycles)
- DSIP: 100-200mcg at bedtime
- Supporting: Quality sleep, antioxidants, stress management

### Cognitive Enhancement (8 weeks)
- SEMAX: 200-600mcg daily (intranasal)
- SELANK: 250-500mcg daily (intranasal)
- Supporting: Exercise, meditation, sleep optimization

### Immune Support (12 weeks)
- Thymosin Alpha-1: 1.6-4.5mg 2x weekly
- Supporting: Vitamin D, zinc, quality sleep

## Safety & Considerations

- **Epitalon**: Generally well-tolerated; effects cumulative
- **DSIP**: May cause mild drowsiness; use at bedtime
- **Thymosin α1**: Well-tolerated; generally safe
- **SEMAX/SELANK**: Intranasal administration easy; minimal side effects
## Research Status

- Epitalon: Grade C-D evidence; Russian research strong
- DSIP: Grade C-D evidence; multiple clinical studies
- Thymosin α1: Grade B-C evidence; established safety profile
- SEMAX/SELANK: Grade C-D evidence; extensive use in Russia

## Best Practices

1. **Cycle duration**: 4-12 weeks on, or compound-specific cycles (e.g., Epitalon 10-day cycles)
2. **Combination**: Can stack multiple compounds
3. **Consistency**: Daily dosing more important than high doses
4. **Monitoring**: Track sleep quality, cognitive function, general health
