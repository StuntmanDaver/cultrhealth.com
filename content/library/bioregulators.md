# Bioregulators, Neuropeptides & Immune Modulators

## Overview

Bioregulators are peptides that influence systemic regulatory functions: immune support, sleep optimization, cognitive enhancement, anti-aging mechanisms, hormonal signaling, and pigmentation. These compounds work through neuroendocrine, melanocortin, and immune-modulatory pathways.
