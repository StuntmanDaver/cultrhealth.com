# Lab Instructions

Your lab work is an essential part of your CULTR Health protocol. Follow these guidelines to ensure accurate results and a smooth experience.

---

## Pre-Lab Preparation

Proper preparation ensures accurate and reliable lab results.

### Fasting Requirements

- **Fast for 10-12 hours** before your blood draw (water is allowed and encouraged)
- Avoid alcohol for **24 hours** before your appointment
- Avoid strenuous exercise for **24 hours** prior
- Continue taking prescribed medications unless your provider instructs otherwise

### Hydration

- Drink **plenty of water** the evening before and morning of your lab draw
- Proper hydration makes veins easier to locate and reduces discomfort
- Avoid caffeinated beverages during your fasting window

### Medications & Supplements

- **Continue** prescription medications unless specifically told to stop
- **Hold** biotin/B7 supplements for **72 hours** before labs (can interfere with thyroid and hormone tests)
- **Hold** peptide injections the morning of your draw unless instructed otherwise
- Inform the phlebotomist of all current medications and supplements

---

## What to Bring

- **Government-issued photo ID** (driver's license, passport)
- **Insurance card** (if applicable)
- **Lab order/requisition** — provided by your CULTR provider (check your email or member portal)
- **List of current medications** including dosages
- Wear a **short-sleeved shirt** or one with sleeves that roll up easily

## At the Lab

### During Your Visit

1. **Check in** with the front desk and present your lab order and ID
2. **Confirm your identity** — the phlebotomist will verify your name and date of birth
3. **Communicate** any concerns about needles or if you've had difficulty with blood draws before
4. **Stay relaxed** — look away if needles make you uncomfortable, and take deep breaths
5. The draw typically takes **5-10 minutes**

### Tips for a Better Experience

- Request a **butterfly needle** if you have small or difficult veins
- Ask to **lie down** if you feel lightheaded during blood draws
- Keep your arm **straight and still** during the draw
- Apply **firm pressure** to the site for 3-5 minutes after the draw

---

## Post-Lab Care

- Keep the bandage on for at least **1 hour**
- Avoid **heavy lifting** with the draw arm for **4-6 hours**
- If bruising occurs, apply a cold compress — this is normal and will resolve in a few days
- **Eat and hydrate** after your appointment, especially if you were fasting
- Resume normal activities, including medications and supplements
