- **Thymosin Alpha-1** (1.5mg 2x/week) -- immune support during high-stress social periods

### What to Track

- Sleep consistency and quality (even 2-3 nights/week of good sleep matters)
- Skin clarity and hydration (photos monthly)
- Energy levels and mood (simple 1-10 daily log)
- Body weight trends (weekly average, not daily)

### Avoid for This Persona

- Using peptides as a substitute for basic habits (hydration, sleep, nutrition)

- Neglecting sleep in favor of productivity gains from nootropic peptides
- Stacking SEMAX + Selank + caffeine without testing each individually first

---

## Weight Loss / Metabolic Health Seeker (18+)

**Goal**: Sustainable fat loss, appetite control, and metabolic optimization without muscle wasting.

### Baseline Stack

| Compound | Dose Range | Timing | Purpose |
|----------|-----------|--------|---------|
| Tesamorelin | 1-2mg daily | Before bed | Visceral fat reduction, GH-mediated metabolic optimization |
| RTA | 1-12mg weekly | Same day each week | Triple-agonist appetite regulation + metabolic optimization |
| BPC-157 | 250mcg/day | AM | GI support during GLP-1 adjustment |

### Add-ons

- **CJC-1295 / Ipamorelin** (100-200mcg nightly) -- alternative GH secretagogue pairing if Tesamorelin unavailable
- **Cagrilintide** (0.25-2.4mg weekly) -- amylin pathway for enhanced satiety when combined with GLP-1 agonists (RTA, semaglutide)
- **AOD-9604** (300mcg AM fasted) -- targeted fat mobilization
- **MOTS-C** (5-10mg 3-5x weekly) -- metabolic activation and exercise capacity

### What to Track

- Body measurements (waist, hips, chest monthly)
- Protein intake (minimum 0.8g/lb target body weight)
- GI symptoms log (nausea, constipation -- common with GLP-1s)
- Fasting glucose and HbA1c every 90 days

### Avoid for This Persona

- Stacking RTA or other GLP-1 agonists with cagrilintide without slow independent titration of each
- Excessive caloric restriction -- GLP-1s reduce appetite naturally, severe deficits cause muscle loss
- Skipping protein tracking -- muscle preservation requires adequate protein even with reduced appetite
- Running fat-loss peptides (AOD-9604) with a fed-state dose -- fasting required for efficacy

---

## Biohacker / Quantified Self

**Goal**: Optimize biomarkers, extend healthspan, and push biological age below chronological age using data-driven protocols.

### Baseline Stack

| Compound | Dose Range | Timing | Purpose |
|----------|-----------|--------|---------|
| Tesamorelin | 1-2mg daily | Before bed | GH release, visceral fat reduction, longevity marker optimization |
| Epitalon | 5-10mg/day (10-20 day cycles, 2-3x/year) | AM or PM | Telomere lengthening, pineal function |
| BPC-157 | 250-500mcg/day | AM + PM split | Systemic anti-inflammatory, gut optimization |
| SEMAX | 200-600mcg/day | AM intranasal | Cognitive optimization, BDNF upregulation |

### Add-ons

- **CJC-1295 / Ipamorelin** (200-300mcg nightly) -- alternative GH secretagogue pairing if Tesamorelin unavailable

- HRV trends (daily morning reading)
- Sleep architecture (Oura, WHOOP, or similar)
- Telomere length (baseline + annually if available)
- Cognitive benchmarks (Cambridge Brain Sciences, dual n-back)

### Avoid for This Persona

- Running too many compounds simultaneously without isolating variables
- Chasing biomarker numbers without assessing how you actually feel
- Over-testing and over-optimizing -- some markers fluctuate naturally
- Ignoring the basics (sleep, nutrition, exercise) while focusing on peptide stacks

---

## Skin & Confidence

**Goal**: Improve skin quality, reduce signs of aging, support hair health, and boost physical confidence through targeted repair compounds.

### Baseline Stack

| Compound | Dose Range | Timing | Purpose |
|----------|-----------|--------|---------|
| Tesamorelin | 1-2mg daily | Before bed | GH release for skin turnover, collagen synthesis, body composition |
| GHK-Cu | 1-3mg/day | AM or split AM/PM | Collagen synthesis, skin elasticity, hair follicle support |
| BPC-157 | 250mcg/day | AM | Gut-skin axis, systemic healing |

### Add-ons

- **CJC-1295 / Ipamorelin** (100-200mcg nightly) -- alternative GH secretagogue pairing if Tesamorelin unavailable
- **Epithalon** (5-10mg/day, 10-day cycles) -- cellular renewal and anti-aging at the telomere level
- **TB-500** (2mg 2x/week) -- wound healing, reduces scarring, supports hair growth
- **Thymosin Alpha-1** (1.5mg 2x/week) -- immune balance (helpful for inflammatory skin conditions)

### What to Track

- Progress photos (same lighting, weekly)
- Skin hydration levels (at-home moisture meter or dermatologist assessment)
- Hair density and shedding patterns
- Collagen markers if available (procollagen type I, hydroxyproline)
- Sleep quality (GH release is critical for skin repair)

### Avoid for This Persona

- Expecting overnight results -- collagen remodeling takes 8-12 weeks minimum
- Using GHK-Cu topically AND systemically at high doses without provider guidance
- Neglecting sun protection -- peptides support repair but cannot overcome UV damage
- Skipping gut health -- skin issues often originate from gut inflammation

---

## Focus Seeker

**Goal**: Improve sustained attention, reduce mental fog, and support executive function through targeted neuropeptides and systemic support.

### Baseline Stack

| Compound | Dose Range | Timing | Purpose |
|----------|-----------|--------|---------|
| SEMAX | 200-600mcg/day | AM intranasal | Attention, working memory, BDNF support |
| Selank | 250-500mcg/day | AM intranasal | Calm focus, reduces anxiety-driven distraction |
| BPC-157 | 250mcg/day | AM | Gut-brain axis, dopamine system support |

### Add-ons

- **DSIP** (100mcg nightly) -- sleep architecture support (poor sleep is the top focus killer)
- **CJC-1295 / Ipamorelin** (100-200mcg nightly) -- GH-mediated cognitive recovery during sleep
- **Thymosin Alpha-1** (1.5mg 2x/week) -- neuroinflammation modulation
- **NAD+** (100-250mg weekly) -- cellular energy and brain metabolism support

### What to Track

- Focus duration (timed deep-work blocks, Pomodoro tracking)
- Task completion rate and daily output
- Sleep quality and consistency (this is non-negotiable for focus)
- Mood and anxiety levels (1-10 daily, look for trends)
- Side effects log (headache, overstimulation, sleep disruption)

### Avoid for This Persona

- Using SEMAX + Selank + stimulants (caffeine, Adderall) simultaneously without careful titration
- Treating neuropeptides as a substitute for sleep, exercise, and stress management
- Running nootropic peptides continuously without cycling (4 weeks on, 2 weeks off recommended)
- Self-adjusting doses based on "feel" without tracking objective metrics

## Peptide Axes -- Systems-Level Reference

The persona stacks above are organized by lifestyle goal. The axes below reorganize the same compounds (and others) by **biological pathway** -- giving you a mechanistic map of how peptides interact within and across systems. Use this section to understand *why* certain combinations work, identify synergy opportunities, and avoid pathway conflicts.

---

### GH Axis / Anabolic Signaling Network

**Core Peptides**

- **GHRH Analogs** -- CJC-1295 (DAC and no-DAC), Sermorelin, Tesamorelin
- **GH Secretagogues (GHRPs)** -- Ipamorelin, GHRP-2, GHRP-6, Hexarelin, MK-677 (oral)
- **Downstream Effectors** -- IGF-1 LR3, MGF (Mechano Growth Factor), PEG-MGF

**Mechanistic Complementarity**

GHRH analogs amplify the pituitary's natural GH pulse, while GHRPs act on ghrelin receptors to initiate the pulse. Combining one from each class (e.g., CJC-1295 no-DAC + Ipamorelin) creates a synergistic signal that exceeds either alone -- this is the most commonly prescribed GH-axis pairing. Downstream effectors like IGF-1 LR3 bypass the pituitary entirely, acting directly at tissue level for localized anabolic effects.

- **Tesamorelin** stands apart as the only FDA-approved GHRH analog, with strong evidence for visceral fat reduction specifically
- **MK-677** provides oral convenience but acts 24/7 (not pulsatile), which can increase insulin resistance over time
- **IGF-1 LR3** has a 20+ hour half-life and systemic anabolic effects -- potent but requires careful dosing

**Risk / Caution Notes**

- Stacking multiple GHRPs (e.g., GHRP-6 + Hexarelin + MK-677) dramatically increases prolactin and cortisol -- avoid without bloodwork monitoring
- Chronic GH elevation can impair insulin sensitivity -- check fasting glucose and HbA1c every 90 days
- Pituitary desensitization occurs with continuous use -- cycle 8-12 weeks on, 4 weeks off for secretagogues
- IGF-1 levels above the reference range may accelerate growth of existing neoplasms -- discuss cancer screening history with your provider
- MK-677's appetite increase and water retention are side effects, not features -- titrate slowly

---

### Tissue Repair / Regeneration Axis

**Core Peptides**

- **BPC-157** (Body Protection Compound) -- gastric pentadecapeptide, systemic repair signaling, angiogenesis, gut-brain axis
- **TB-500** (Thymosin Beta-4 fragment) -- actin regulation, cell migration, systemic wound healing
- **GHK-Cu** -- copper-binding tripeptide, collagen synthesis, gene expression modulation (~4,000 genes), anti-inflammatory
- **KPV** -- alpha-MSH fragment, potent anti-inflammatory, gut mucosal repair
- **LL-37** -- human cathelicidin, antimicrobial, biofilm disruption, immune modulation
- **ARA-290** -- erythropoietin-derived, innate repair receptor agonist, neuropathic pain, tissue protection

**Mechanistic Complementarity**

BPC-157 and TB-500 are the foundational repair pair -- BPC-157 signals repair at the cellular level (upregulating growth factor receptors, modulating nitric oxide, protecting endothelium) while TB-500 facilitates cell migration to injury sites. GHK-Cu adds matrix remodeling and collagen scaffolding. For inflammatory conditions, KPV addresses mucosal inflammation directly while LL-37 handles microbial components.

- **BPC-157 + TB-500** -- the classic repair stack. BPC-157 initiates repair signaling; TB-500 mobilizes cells to the site
- **GHK-Cu** -- acts upstream on gene expression, resetting cells toward a repair phenotype
- **ARA-290** -- uniquely targets the innate repair receptor (distinct from erythropoietin receptor), making it safe for tissue protection without hematopoietic effects

**Risk / Caution Notes**

- BPC-157 upregulates growth factor pathways -- theoretical concern with active malignancies (no human data confirming risk, but discuss with provider)
- TB-500 can transiently lower blood pressure -- start at lower doses if hypotension-prone
- LL-37 at high doses can shift from anti-inflammatory to pro-inflammatory -- dose-response is non-linear
- Repair peptides are not substitutes for mechanical rest -- a torn ligament still needs immobilization
- Cycle repair stacks: 8-12 weeks on, 4 weeks off, reassess

---

### Neurocognitive / Neurotrophic Axis

**Core Peptides**

- **Semax** -- synthetic ACTH(4-10) analog, BDNF/NGF upregulation, dopaminergic/serotonergic modulation, neuroprotection
- **Selank** -- tuftsin analog, anxiolytic, GABA modulation, immune–neuro interface
- **Pinealon** -- tripeptide bioregulator, pineal gland function, circadian regulation
- **DSIP** (Delta Sleep-Inducing Peptide) -- sleep architecture, stress adaptation, cortisol modulation
- **Epithalon** (Epitalon) -- telomerase activation, pineal melatonin regulation, circadian entrainment
- **MOTS-c** -- mitochondrial-derived peptide, metabolic regulation with emerging cognitive benefits via cellular energy

**Mechanistic Complementarity**

Semax and Selank represent complementary neurocognitive pathways -- Semax drives excitatory neurotrophic signaling (BDNF, NGF, dopamine), while Selank provides inhibitory balance (GABA enhancement, anxiolysis). Together they create a "calm focus" state. Pinealon and Epithalon both act on the pineal–circadian system but through different mechanisms: Pinealon directly modulates pineal peptide expression, while Epithalon reactivates telomerase in pinealocytes, restoring melatonin synthesis capacity. DSIP acts downstream on sleep architecture.

- **Semax + Selank** (AM intranasal) -- the core nootropic pairing: focus + calm without sedation
- **DSIP + Epithalon** (PM) -- sleep depth + circadian reset for cognitive recovery
- **Pinealon** -- bridges the daytime cognitive stack and the nighttime recovery stack

**Risk / Caution Notes**

- Semax can overstimulate in anxiety-prone individuals -- start at 200mcg, assess for 5-7 days before increasing
- Selank may cause mild sedation at higher doses -- adjust timing if afternoon drowsiness occurs
- Do not combine Semax with MAOIs or high-dose stimulants without provider supervision
- DSIP is not a sedative -- it modulates sleep stages but won't force sleep onset; address sleep hygiene first
- Epithalon is used in short cycles (10-20 days, 2-3x per year) -- not for continuous use
- Neuropeptides are research compounds -- long-term safety data in humans is limited

---

### Libido / Reproductive Axis

**Core Peptides**

- **PT-141** (Bremelanotide) -- melanocortin-4 receptor agonist, centrally-mediated sexual arousal (FDA-approved for HSDD in women)
- **Kisspeptin** -- hypothalamic GnRH pulse generator, upstream regulator of the entire HPG axis
- **Gonadorelin** -- synthetic GnRH, stimulates LH/FSH release, used for HPG axis maintenance or restart
- **Oxytocin** -- bonding, arousal facilitation, smooth muscle contraction, prosocial effects
- **Thymosin Alpha-1** -- immune modulation with downstream effects on reproductive immune tolerance

**Mechanistic Complementarity**

PT-141 acts centrally in the brain (melanocortin pathway), making it unique among sexual health compounds -- it does not depend on vascular mechanisms like PDE5 inhibitors. Kisspeptin and Gonadorelin both act on the hypothalamic–pituitary–gonadal (HPG) axis but at different levels: Kisspeptin triggers GnRH neurons upstream, while Gonadorelin is GnRH itself. Oxytocin adds a neuroendocrine bonding/arousal layer.

- **PT-141** -- on-demand use for acute arousal enhancement (2-6 hours before activity)
- **Kisspeptin + Gonadorelin** -- used for HPG axis preservation during or after exogenous hormone use
- **Oxytocin** -- intranasal for prosocial/bonding effects, or as part of a provider-guided reproductive protocol

**Risk / Caution Notes**

- PT-141 commonly causes nausea (dose-dependent) -- start at 1mg subcutaneous, max 1.75mg, no more than once per 24 hours
- PT-141 can raise blood pressure transiently -- avoid in uncontrolled hypertension
- Kisspeptin and Gonadorelin can paradoxically suppress the HPG axis with continuous (non-pulsatile) administration -- pulsatile dosing protocols are critical
- Gonadorelin is NOT a testosterone replacement -- it stimulates the axis but requires functional testes/ovaries
- Reproductive peptides should always be managed alongside hormone panels (LH, FSH, total/free testosterone, estradiol, SHBG)
- Do not self-prescribe reproductive-axis peptides -- HPG disruption can cause lasting hormonal imbalance

---

### Metabolic / Fat-Loss Axis

**Core Peptides**

- **Incretin / GLP-1 Family** -- Semaglutide, Tirzepatide (GIP/GLP-1), Retatrutide (GIP/GLP-1/GCGR triple agonist), Cagrilintide (amylin analog)
- **GH-Mediated Metabolic Agents** -- AOD-9604 (GH fragment 176-191), Tesamorelin (GHRH for visceral fat), CJC-1295 / Ipamorelin (indirect metabolic via GH)
- **Mitochondrial Metabolic Peptides** -- MOTS-c (exercise mimetic, AMPK activation), 5-Amino-1MQ (NNMT inhibitor, NAD+ salvage)

**Mechanistic Complementarity**

The incretin family works top-down via appetite/satiety signaling in the gut-brain axis. AOD-9604 works bottom-up at the adipocyte level, mimicking the lipolytic fragment of growth hormone without its anabolic or diabetogenic effects. MOTS-c and 5-Amino-1MQ act at the cellular energy level -- MOTS-c activates AMPK (the "energy sensor") while 5-Amino-1MQ blocks NNMT, shunting metabolic flux toward NAD+ production and fat oxidation.

- **Incretin + AOD-9604** -- appetite suppression (central) + fat mobilization (peripheral) for dual-mechanism fat loss
- **Tesamorelin** -- specifically targets visceral adipose tissue via GH pathway; FDA-approved for HIV lipodystrophy
- **MOTS-c** -- the "exercise mimetic" -- activates metabolic pathways normally triggered by exercise, useful for metabolically inflexible patients

**Risk / Caution Notes**

- Never stack multiple GLP-1 agonists (e.g., semaglutide + tirzepatide) -- overlapping mechanisms increase GI side effects and hypoglycemia risk
- Cagrilintide is designed to pair with GLP-1s but requires independent slow titration of each -- do not start both simultaneously
- AOD-9604 must be dosed fasted (AM, 30+ minutes before eating) -- insulin presence abolishes its lipolytic effect
- GLP-1 agonists cause muscle loss alongside fat loss -- protein intake (≥0.8g/lb target body weight) and resistance training are non-negotiable
- MOTS-c can cause transient flushing and injection-site reactions -- start at 5mg and titrate
- Metabolic peptides do not replace caloric awareness -- they change the effort required, not the physics

---

### Immune / Thymic Axis

**Core Peptides**

- **Thymosin Alpha-1 (Ta1)** -- thymic peptide, restores T-cell function, NK cell activation, dendritic cell maturation (approved in 30+ countries for hepatitis B/C and as immune adjuvant)
- **Thymalin** -- thymic extract bioregulator, thymic tissue regeneration, T-cell maturation
- **Thymulin** -- zinc-dependent nonapeptide, thymic hormone, T-cell differentiation and immune calibration
- **LL-37** -- cathelicidin antimicrobial peptide, innate immune defense, biofilm disruption, wound healing
- **KPV** -- alpha-MSH C-terminal tripeptide, anti-inflammatory, NF-kB inhibition, gut mucosal immune modulation

**Mechanistic Complementarity**

Thymosin Alpha-1, Thymalin, and Thymulin all target thymic function but through different mechanisms: Ta1 is a defined 28-amino-acid peptide that activates toll-like receptors and promotes T-cell maturation; Thymalin is a broader thymic extract that supports thymic tissue regeneration; Thymulin requires zinc as a cofactor and specifically drives T-cell differentiation. LL-37 and KPV address the innate immune system -- LL-37 on the antimicrobial/barrier side, KPV on the anti-inflammatory side.

- **Ta1 + KPV** -- adaptive immune support + inflammation control for chronic inflammatory conditions
- **LL-37** -- targeted use for recurrent infections, biofilm-associated conditions, or post-surgical immune support
- **Thymalin** -- short-course thymic regeneration (typically 10-day cycles)

**Risk / Caution Notes**

- Immune-modulating peptides should be avoided or carefully monitored in autoimmune conditions -- enhancing immune function can worsen autoimmune flares
- Ta1 is generally well-tolerated but can cause injection-site reactions and flu-like symptoms during initial immune activation
- LL-37 has a narrow therapeutic window -- pro-inflammatory at high doses, anti-inflammatory at moderate doses
- Thymulin requires adequate zinc status to function -- check zinc levels before starting
- Do not use immune peptides as substitutes for vaccines, antibiotics, or standard immunotherapy
- Cycle immune peptides: 10-day courses for Thymalin, 8-12 weeks for Ta1, reassess with immune panels

---

### Mitochondrial / Longevity Axis

**Core Peptides**

- **SS-31 (Elamipretide)** -- cardiolipin-binding peptide, stabilizes inner mitochondrial membrane, restores electron transport chain efficiency
- **MOTS-c** -- mitochondrial-derived peptide, AMPK activation, metabolic homeostasis, exercise mimetic
- **NAD+ Precursors** (NMN, NR -- not peptides, but synergistic) -- substrate for sirtuins, PARPs, and mitochondrial function
- **Epithalon** -- telomerase activation, pineal melatonin restoration, epigenetic clock modulation
- **Pinealon** -- pineal bioregulator, circadian peptide signaling, neuroprotective
- **SLU-PP-332** (investigational) -- ERRα/γ agonist, mitochondrial biogenesis, endurance enhancement, "exercise in a pill" candidate

**Mechanistic Complementarity**

Mitochondrial decline is a hallmark of aging. SS-31 addresses this at the organelle level by stabilizing cardiolipin (critical for Complex III/IV function), directly improving mitochondrial energy output. MOTS-c acts as a retrograde signal from mitochondria to the nucleus, activating AMPK and metabolic stress responses. NAD+ precursors provide substrate for the sirtuin family (SIRT1-7) which regulate mitochondrial biogenesis, DNA repair, and epigenetic maintenance. Epithalon and Pinealon address the circadian–mitochondrial interface -- disrupted circadian signaling impairs mitophagy and mitochondrial quality control.

- **SS-31 + MOTS-c** -- structural mitochondrial repair + metabolic activation signal
- **NAD+ + Epithalon** -- substrate replenishment + epigenetic clock modulation
- **Pinealon** -- circadian restoration supports mitophagy timing

**Risk / Caution Notes**

- SS-31 is still in clinical trials for specific indications (Barth syndrome, heart failure) -- off-label use should be provider-supervised
- MOTS-c can cause injection-site reactions and transient GI effects -- titrate from 5mg
- NAD+ precursors (especially IV NAD+) can cause intense flushing, nausea, and anxiety at higher doses -- oral NMN/NR is better tolerated
- Epithalon is cycled in short bursts (10-20 days, 2-3x per year) -- telomerase activation in the context of existing malignancy is a theoretical concern
- SLU-PP-332 is preclinical -- no human safety data exists; included for educational awareness only
- Longevity peptides require patience -- meaningful biomarker changes take 6-12+ months of consistent use

---

### Aesthetic / Dermatologic Axis

**Core Peptides**

- **GHK-Cu** -- copper peptide, collagen I/III synthesis, elastin production, gene expression reset toward a "younger" phenotype, anti-inflammatory
- **SNAP-8** (Acetyl Octapeptide-3) -- SNARE complex modulator, reduces neuromuscular signaling at the skin surface, "topical Botox" effect on expression lines
- **Melanotan I** (Afamelanotide) -- melanocortin-1 receptor agonist, stimulates eumelanin production, photoprotection (FDA-approved for EPP)
- **Melanotan II** -- non-selective melanocortin agonist, tanning + appetite suppression + libido effects (broader receptor profile than MT-I)
- **TB-500** -- wound healing, reduces scarring, supports hair follicle cycling

**Mechanistic Complementarity**

GHK-Cu is the foundation of any aesthetic peptide protocol -- it modulates ~4,000 genes, shifting expression toward regeneration, collagen production, and reduced inflammation. SNAP-8 works topically at the neuromuscular junction to soften dynamic wrinkles. The Melanotan peptides stimulate melanogenesis for UV protection and cosmetic tanning. TB-500 accelerates wound healing and reduces scar formation, making it valuable post-procedure.

- **GHK-Cu (systemic) + SNAP-8 (topical)** -- deep matrix remodeling + surface wrinkle reduction
- **GHK-Cu + TB-500** -- collagen synthesis + wound healing for post-procedure recovery or scar reduction
- **Melanotan I** -- the safer melanocortin option for photoprotection (selective MC1R agonist)

**Risk / Caution Notes**

- Melanotan II has a broad receptor profile (MC1R–MC5R) -- side effects include nausea, facial flushing, libido changes, and darkening of existing moles/nevi
- Any pigmentation changes from Melanotan require dermatologic monitoring -- darkening of atypical moles is a red flag
- SNAP-8 is topical only -- it does not cross skin effectively without delivery vehicles (liposomal formulations preferred)
- GHK-Cu can darken hair -- cosmetically desirable for some, unwanted for others
- Aesthetic results are gradual -- 8-12 weeks minimum for visible collagen remodeling
- Always combine aesthetic peptides with sun protection, hydration, and basic skincare

### Conceptual "Synergy Layers" -- A Framework for Rational Stacking

Rather than thinking of peptide stacking as "adding more compounds," consider it as **layering biological systems**. Each layer addresses a different level of physiological function, and the most effective stacks work across layers rather than within a single layer.

**Layer 1 -- Repair & Foundation**
The base layer. Tissue integrity, gut health, and systemic inflammation control. Without this layer, compounds in higher layers operate in a compromised environment.
- *Key peptides:* BPC-157, TB-500, GHK-Cu, KPV

**Layer 2 -- Signaling & Hormonal**
Endocrine optimization. Growth hormone axis, metabolic signaling, reproductive axis calibration. This layer amplifies the body's own regulatory systems.
- *Key peptides:* CJC-1295 / Ipamorelin, Tesamorelin, GLP-1 agonists, Gonadorelin, Kisspeptin

**Layer 3 -- Immune Calibration**
Immune surveillance, thymic function, antimicrobial defense. This layer determines how well the body handles infections, autoimmune pressure, and chronic inflammation.
- *Key peptides:* Thymosin Alpha-1, Thymalin, LL-37, KPV

**Layer 4 -- Neurocognitive & Circadian**
Brain function, mood, focus, sleep architecture, circadian rhythm. This layer optimizes the command center that coordinates all other systems.
- *Key peptides:* Semax, Selank, DSIP, Pinealon, Epithalon

**Layer 5 -- Mitochondrial & Longevity**
Cellular energy production, epigenetic maintenance, telomere integrity. This is the deepest layer -- operating at the level of cellular aging itself.
- *Key peptides:* SS-31, MOTS-c, NAD+ precursors, Epithalon

**How to Use This Framework**

1. **Build from the bottom up.** Start with Layer 1 (repair) before adding higher layers. A damaged gut or chronic inflammation will blunt the effects of everything above it.
2. **Limit to 2-3 layers at a time.** More layers means more variables, more interactions, and more difficulty attributing results to specific compounds.
3. **One new compound per layer per cycle.** When expanding, add one compound from a new layer -- don't add three compounds from three layers simultaneously.
4. **Cross-layer synergies are more powerful than within-layer stacking.** BPC-157 (Layer 1) + CJC-1295/Ipa (Layer 2) + Semax (Layer 4) covers three systems with minimal overlap. Three GH secretagogues (all Layer 2) create redundancy and side-effect stacking.
5. **Track by layer.** Assign your metrics to layers -- gut symptoms (L1), body composition (L2), immune events (L3), cognitive performance (L4), energy/recovery (L5) -- so you know which layer is responding.

---

## General Stacking Rules

1. **Start one compound at a time** -- add a new compound every 2-3 weeks so you can identify what works (and what causes side effects)
2. **Cycle everything** -- most peptides benefit from periodic breaks (typically 8-12 weeks on, 4 weeks off)
3. **Track before you stack** -- establish baseline metrics before starting any protocol
4. **Bloodwork is mandatory** -- comprehensive panels at baseline, 90 days, and ongoing quarterly
5. **Talk to your provider** -- these guides are starting points, not prescriptions. Your CULTR provider will personalize based on your labs, history, and goals
6. **Basics first** -- no peptide stack can compensate for poor sleep, inadequate protein, dehydration, or chronic stress
