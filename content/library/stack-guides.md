## Weight Loss / Metabolic Health Seeker (18+)

**Goal**: Sustainable fat loss, appetite control, and metabolic optimization without muscle wasting.

### Baseline Stack

| Compound | Dose Range | Timing | Purpose |

- **AOD-9604** (300mcg AM fasted) -- targeted fat mobilization
- **Tesamorelin** (1-2mg daily) -- visceral fat reduction specifically
- **MOTS-C** (5-10mg 3-5x weekly) -- metabolic activation and exercise capacity

### What to Track

- Weekly weight trend (morning fasted, same day)
- Body measurements (waist, hips, chest monthly)
- Protein intake (minimum 0.8g/lb target body weight)
- GI symptoms log (nausea, constipation -- common with GLP-1s)
- Fasting glucose and HbA1c every 90 days

### Avoid for This Persona

- Stacking semaglutide + cagrilintide without slow independent titration of each
- Excessive caloric restriction -- GLP-1s reduce appetite naturally, severe deficits cause muscle loss
- Skipping protein tracking -- muscle preservation requires adequate protein even with reduced appetite
- Running fat-loss peptides (AOD-9604) with a fed-state dose -- fasting required for efficacy

### Avoid for This Persona

- Using SEMAX + Selank + stimulants (caffeine, Adderall) simultaneously without careful titration
- Treating neuropeptides as a substitute for sleep, exercise, and stress management
- Running nootropic peptides continuously without cycling (4 weeks on, 2 weeks off recommended)
- Self-adjusting doses based on "feel" without tracking objective metrics

## General Stacking Rules

1. **Start one compound at a time** -- add a new compound every 2-3 weeks so you can identify what works (and what causes side effects)
2. **Cycle everything** -- most peptides benefit from periodic breaks (typically 8-12 weeks on, 4 weeks off)
3. **Track before you stack** -- establish baseline metrics before starting any protocol
4. **Bloodwork is mandatory** -- comprehensive panels at baseline, 90 days, and ongoing quarterly
5. **Talk to your provider** -- these guides are starting points, not prescriptions. Your CULTR provider will personalize based on your labs, history, and goals
6. **Basics first** -- no peptide stack can compensate for poor sleep, inadequate protein, dehydration, or chronic stress
