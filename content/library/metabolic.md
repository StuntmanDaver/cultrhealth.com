# Metabolic & Weight Loss Peptides

## Overview

Metabolic peptides support fat loss, glucose control, and appetite regulation. Many are GLP-1 receptor agonists or work synergistically with similar mechanisms.

## Quick Reference

| Product | Size | Risk | Best For |
|---------|------|------|----------|
| RTA | 5mg | Moderate | Triple GLP-1/GIP/Glucagon metabolic optimization |
| Cagrilintide | 5mg | Moderate | GLP-1 + Amylin pathway |
| Sema + Cagri Blend | 5mg + 5mg | Moderate | Combined metabolic support |
| AOD-9604 | 5mg | Low-Moderate | Direct fat mobilization |

## Key Compounds

### Retatrutide (RTA)
**Mechanism**: Triple agonist targeting GLP-1, GIP, and Glucagon receptors for maximum metabolic optimization

**Typical Use**: 1-12mg weekly (slow titration)
**Route**: Subcutaneous
**Duration**: Ongoing (titrate based on tolerance and goals)
**Notes**: Most potent metabolic compound available; up to 24% body weight reduction in clinical trials. CULTR's primary GLP recommendation.

### Cagrilintide
**Mechanism**: Amylin receptor agonist that slows gastric emptying and enhances satiety

**Typical Use**: 0.25-2.4mg weekly (slow titration)
**Route**: Subcutaneous
**Duration**: Ongoing (titrate based on tolerance)
**Notes**: Emerging compound with strong appetite suppression

### Semaglutide + Cagrilintide Stack
**Combined Mechanism**: GLP-1 agonist + Amylin agonist for enhanced metabolic effect

**Typical Use**: Semaglutide 0.25-2.4mg weekly + Cagrilintide 0.25-2.4mg weekly (titrate slowly)
**Route**: Subcutaneous
**Duration**: Ongoing
**Best For**: Significant weight loss goals
**Note**: RTA is the preferred primary GLP compound; this combination is an alternative approach

### AOD-9604
**Mechanism**: Growth hormone fragment that stimulates lipolysis and inhibits lipogenesis without affecting blood sugar

**Typical Use**: 250-500mcg daily
**Route**: Subcutaneous
**Duration**: 8-12 weeks
**Unique**: Targeted fat reduction without systemic HGH effects

## Optimal Timing Guide

| Product | Optimal Timing | Category | Notes |
|---------|---------------|----------|-------|
| Cagrilintide | Same day each week | Flexible/Situational | Weekly injection; pick consistent day/time |
| Semaglutide | Same day each week | Flexible/Situational | Weekly injection; consistency critical |
| AOD-9604 | Morning (fasted) or pre-cardio | Morning | Empty stomach 2-3 hours before/after |
| RTA | Morning or consistent daytime | Morning | Metabolic consistency |

**Key Rules**:
- **GLP-1 weekly injections (RTA, semaglutide)**: Same day and time every week; set a recurring reminder
- **Fat-loss peptides (AOD-9604)**: Fasted morning or 2-3 hours after last meal
- **Hydration**: GI side effects from GLP-1 agonists require adequate hydration throughout day

## Metabolic Optimization Protocols

### Conservative Approach (Weight Maintenance + Body Recomposition)
- Cagrilintide: 0.25mg weekly (titrate as needed)
- Lifestyle: Caloric balance with protein emphasis
- Duration: 8-12 weeks

### Aggressive Fat Loss (Deficit-Based)
- RTA: 1-12mg weekly (titrate as tolerated) — primary GLP compound
- Cagrilintide: 0.25-0.5mg weekly (optional add-on)
- Caloric deficit: 300-500 kcal/day
- Protein: 1g per lb body weight

## Safety Considerations

- **Nausea**: Common with GLP-1 agonists; subsides with time
- **Dehydration**: Maintain excellent hydration
- **Blood Sugar**: Monitor glucose, especially if diabetic
- **Thyroid**: Watch for thyroid C-cell effects (from preclinical data)
