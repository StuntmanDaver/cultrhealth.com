# Repair & Recovery Peptides

## Overview

Tissue repair and recovery peptides accelerate healing of injuries, tendon/ligament damage, and general tissue remodeling. These compounds are popular among athletes and fitness enthusiasts for their regenerative properties.

## Quick Reference

| Product | Size | Risk | Best For |
|---------|------|------|----------|
| BPC-157 | 10mg | Low-Moderate | Tendon/ligament healing |
| TB-500 | 10mg | Low-Moderate | Tissue regeneration |
| GHK-Cu | 50mg | Low | Collagen synthesis |
| GLOW Blend | Mixed | Low-Moderate | Comprehensive recovery |
| Elamipretide | 50mg | Moderate | Mitochondrial function |

## Key Compounds

### BPC-157 (Body Protection Compound)
**Mechanism**: Peptide derived from gastric juice; promotes angiogenesis and nerve growth

**Dosage**: 250-500mcg once or twice daily
**Route**: Intramuscular, Intranasal, or Oral
**Duration**: 4-12 weeks
**Common Uses**: Joint recovery, tendon healing, GI health

### TB-500 (Thymosin Beta-4)
**Mechanism**: Actin-binding peptide that upregulates growth factors and immune function

**Dosage**: 2.5-5mg 2x weekly
**Route**: Subcutaneous
**Duration**: 4-12 weeks
**Best For**: General tissue repair, athletic recovery

### GHK-Cu (Copper Peptide)
**Mechanism**: Promotes collagen synthesis and angiogenesis; anti-inflammatory

**Dosage**: 1-2mg daily
**Route**: Topical or subcutaneous
**Duration**: 8-16 weeks
**Best For**: Skin health, collagen remodeling, wound healing

## Optimal Timing Guide

| Product | Optimal Timing | Category | Notes |
|---------|---------------|----------|-------|
| BPC-157 | Flexible | Flexible/Situational | Can dose AM or PM; some prefer near injury site; empty stomach optional |
| TB-500 | Flexible | Flexible/Situational | Timing less critical; typically dosed 2-3x weekly regardless of time |
| GHK-Cu | AM or PM | Flexible/Situational | Injectable: flexible timing; topical: apply to clean skin AM/PM |
| GLOW Blend | Flexible | Flexible/Situational | Follow component timing; consistency over exact timing |
| Elamipretide | Morning (fasted) | Morning | Mitochondrial peptide; morning dosing supports energy throughout day |

**Key Rule**: Repair peptides have timing flexibility — consistency matters more than exact hour. Separate GH-related peptides from repair peptides by 30+ min if stacking.

## Recovery Protocols

### Acute Injury Recovery (4-6 weeks)
- BPC-157: 250-500mcg twice daily
- GHK-Cu: 1mg daily
- Vitamin C: High dose for collagen synthesis

### Long-term Athletic Recovery
- TB-500: 2.5-5mg 2x weekly
- GHK-Cu: 1mg daily
- Adequate protein and minerals

## Safety & Timing

- BPC-157: Generally well-tolerated; monitor for mild nausea
- TB-500: May cause lethargy initially; not recommended before high-intensity training
- GHK-Cu: Safe topically; monitor if using systemically
