# Repair & Recovery Peptides

## Overview

Tissue repair and recovery peptides accelerate healing through angiogenesis, collagen deposition, cell migration, and anti-inflammatory signaling. These compounds target distinct regenerative pathways for injuries, tendon/ligament damage, gut health, and general tissue remodeling.

## Optimal Timing Guide

| Product | Optimal Timing | Notes |
|---------|---------------|-------|
| BPC-157 | Flexible (AM or PM) | Can dose near injury site; empty stomach optional |
| TB-500 | Flexible | Timing less critical; typically dosed 2–3x weekly |
| GHK-Cu | AM or PM | Injectable: flexible; topical: apply to clean skin |
| KPV | As directed | Anti-inflammatory; consistent daily dosing |
| LL-37 | As directed | Antimicrobial support; follow provider guidance |
| GLOW Blend | Flexible | Follow component timing; consistency over exact timing |
| Elamipretide (SS-31) | Morning (fasted) | Mitochondrial energy; morning dosing supports daytime energy |

**Key Rule**: Repair peptides have timing flexibility — consistency matters more than exact hour. Separate GH-related peptides from repair peptides by 30+ min if stacking.

## Recovery Protocols

### Acute Injury Recovery (4–6 weeks)
- BPC-157: 250–500mcg twice daily
- GHK-Cu: 1mg daily
- Vitamin C: High dose for collagen synthesis

### Long-term Athletic Recovery (8–12 weeks)
- TB-500: 2.5–5mg 2x weekly
- GHK-Cu: 1mg daily
- Adequate protein and minerals

### Comprehensive Repair Stack
- GLOW Blend (BPC-157 + TB-500 + GHK-Cu): Per component guidelines
- Elamipretide: 10–40mg daily (morning)
- Best For: Multi-pathway tissue repair with mitochondrial support

### Gut Healing Protocol
- BPC-157: 250–500mcg twice daily (oral or SQ)
- KPV: Daily (anti-inflammatory support)
- Best For: GI repair, leaky gut, inflammatory bowel conditions

## Safety & Considerations

- **BPC-157**: Generally well-tolerated; monitor for mild nausea
- **TB-500**: May cause lethargy initially; not recommended before high-intensity training
- **GHK-Cu**: Safe topically; monitor if using systemically
- **KPV**: Well-tolerated; primarily anti-inflammatory
- **LL-37**: Monitor for injection site reactions
- **Elamipretide**: Generally well-tolerated; monitor for injection site reactions
