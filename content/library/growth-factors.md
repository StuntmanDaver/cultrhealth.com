# Growth Factors & GH Axis Peptides

## Overview

This section covers peptides that promote muscle growth, strength enhancement, and growth hormone optimization. These compounds work through GH secretagogue receptors (GHSR), GHRH receptors, and IGF-1 signaling pathways including PI3K/AKT/mTOR and MAPK/ERK cascades.

  - Satellite cell activation
  - PI3K/AKT/mTOR
  - Muscle repair signaling
- **Best For**: Localized muscle growth and repair
- **Notes**: Post-workout dosing for satellite cell activation

### Follistatin 344
- **Mechanism**: Myostatin antagonist; muscle growth deregulation
- **Pathways**:
  - ↓ Myostatin signaling
  - ↑ Muscle cell proliferation
  - ↑ Lean mass accretion
- **Protocol**: 100–300mcg daily for 10–30 days, repeat monthly
- **Half-life**: Hours
- **Duration**: Pulsed dosing (monthly cycles)

### Sermorelin (GRF 1-29)
- **Primary Target**: GHRH receptor (GHRHR; Gs GPCR)
- **Pathways**:
  - ↑ cAMP → PKA
  - ↑ Pituitary GH release
  - ↑ Hepatic IGF-1 production
- **Protocol**: 200–300mcg daily or before bed
- **Half-life**: 7 minutes
- **Duration**: 3–6 months
- **Side Effects**: Minimal; generally well-tolerated

### CJC-1295 (No DAC)
- **Primary Target**: GHRH receptor (GHRHR; Gs GPCR)
- **Pathways**:
  - ↑ cAMP → PKA
  - ↑ Pituitary GH release
  - ↑ Hepatic IGF-1 production
- **Protocol**: 100mcg nightly
- **Half-life**: Short (No DAC)
- **Duration**: 8–12 weeks
- **Best Stacked With**: Ipamorelin (synergistic GH pulse)

### CJC-1295 (With DAC)
- **Primary Target**: GHRH receptor (GHRHR; Gs GPCR)
- **Pathways**:
  - Same receptor as No DAC variant, extended half-life
  - Prolonged GH pulsatility enhancement
  - ↑ cAMP → PKA
  - ↑ Pituitary GH release
  - ↑ Hepatic IGF-1 production
- **Best For**: Extended GH support without daily dosing
- **Notes**: DAC (Drug Affinity Complex) extends duration of action

### Ipamorelin
- **Primary Target**: GHSR-1a (Ghrelin receptor; Gq-coupled)
- **Pathways**:
  - ↑ Intracellular Ca²⁺
  - ↑ GH pulsatile release
  - Minimal cortisol/prolactin stimulation
- **Protocol**: 200–300mcg 1–3x daily
- **Half-life**: 2 hours
- **Duration**: 8–12 weeks
- **Best For**: Athletes, endurance, clean GH enhancement without hormonal side effects

### GHRP-2 / GHRP-6
- **Primary Target**: GHSR-1a (Ghrelin receptor)
- **Pathways**:
  - ↑ GH secretion
  - ↑ ACTH / cortisol (stronger than Ipamorelin)
  - ↑ Prolactin
- **Best For**: Potent GH secretion when stronger stimulus needed
- **Notes**: GHRP-6 also stimulates appetite; GHRP-2 is more selective

### Hexarelin
- **Primary Target**: GHSR-1a (Ghrelin receptor)
- **Pathways**:
  - Potent GH release
  - Cardiac GH receptor stimulation
  - Possible desensitization risk
- **Best For**: GH elevation with cardiac tissue support
- **Notes**: May require cycling due to receptor desensitization

### Tesamorelin
- **Primary Target**: GHRH receptor (GHRHR)
- **Pathways**:
  - ↑ GH → ↑ IGF-1
  - ↓ Visceral adipose tissue
- **Best For**: Targeted visceral fat reduction, GH optimization
- **Notes**: FDA-approved for HIV-associated lipodystrophy

## Optimal Timing Guide

| Product | Optimal Timing | Notes |
|---------|---------------|-------|
| IGF-1 LR3 | Pre-workout or training window | Muscle signaling; avoid food 2–3h |
| MGF / PEG-MGF | Post-workout | Satellite cell activation window |
| Follistatin 344 | Morning | Consistent daily timing during pulse cycle |
| Sermorelin | Pre-sleep (empty stomach) | GH pulse optimization; fasted 2–3h |
| CJC-1295 (No DAC) | Pre-sleep | GH stimulation; fasted |
| CJC-1295 (With DAC) | Flexible (long half-life) | Less timing-sensitive due to DAC |
| Ipamorelin | Pre-sleep | GH pulse without cortisol; empty stomach |
| CJC-1295 + Ipamorelin | Pre-sleep | Synergistic GH pulse; fasted 2–3h |
| GHRP-2 / GHRP-6 | Pre-sleep or morning | GH secretion; empty stomach |
| Hexarelin | Morning or pre-workout | GH secretagogue; cycle to avoid desensitization |
| Tesamorelin | Evening | GH optimization; fasted preferred |

**Key Rule**: GH-related peptides (Sermorelin, CJC-1295, Ipamorelin, GHRPs) work best on an empty stomach — avoid food 2–3 hours before administration. Insulin blunts GH release.

## GH Axis Protocols

- Duration: 12+ weeks with labs monitoring

### Muscle Growth Stack
- IGF-1 LR3: 20–50mcg pre-workout
- CJC-1295 (No DAC) + Ipamorelin: Pre-sleep
- Follistatin 344: Monthly pulse cycles

## Safety Considerations

- **Joint stress**: Rapid muscle growth can stress connective tissue
- **Insulin sensitivity**: Monitor glucose metabolism with IGF-1 use
- **Hormone levels**: Some compounds affect endogenous hormone production
- **Desensitization**: Hexarelin and GHRPs may desensitize GHSR over time — cycle appropriately
- **Individual variation**: Response varies significantly between individuals
