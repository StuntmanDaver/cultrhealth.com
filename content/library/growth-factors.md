# Growth Factors & Anabolic Peptides

## Overview

This section covers peptides and compounds that promote muscle growth, strength enhancement, and anabolic pathways. These peptides work through various mechanisms including increased protein synthesis, growth hormone secretion, and IGF-1 signaling.

## Quick Reference

| Product | Size | Risk | Best For |
|---------|------|------|----------|
| IGF-1 LR3 | 1mg | Moderate-High | Lean muscle gain, strength |
| Follistatin 344 | 1mg | Moderate | Myostatin inhibition |
| Sermorelin | 5mg | Low-Moderate | GH secretion, recovery |
| CJC-1295 (No DAC) | 5mg | Low-Moderate | GH pulse optimization |
| Ipamorelin | 5mg | Low | GH pulse without cortisol |

## Key Compounds

### IGF-1 LR3
**Mechanism**: Long-acting insulin-like growth factor that promotes protein synthesis and muscle hyperplasia

**Protocol**: 20-50mcg daily or every other day
**Duration**: 4-6 weeks
**Best Stacked With**: CJC-1295, Ipamorelin, BPC-157

### Follistatin 344
**Mechanism**: Antagonist of myostatin and other negative regulators of muscle growth

**Protocol**: 100-300mcg daily for 10-30 days, repeat monthly
**Duration**: Varies (pulsed dosing)

## Optimal Timing Guide

| Product | Optimal Timing | Category | Notes |
|---------|---------------|----------|-------|
| IGF-1 LR3 | Pre-workout or training window | Pre-Workout | Muscle signaling; avoid food 2-3h before |
| Follistatin 344 | Morning | Morning | Consistent daily timing during pulse cycle |
| Sermorelin | Pre-sleep (empty stomach) | Evening/Pre-Sleep | GH pulse optimization; fasted 2-3h |
| CJC-1295 (No DAC) | Pre-sleep | Evening/Pre-Sleep | GH stimulation; fasted |
| Ipamorelin | Pre-sleep | Evening/Pre-Sleep | GH pulse without cortisol; empty stomach |
| CJC-1295 (No DAC) + Ipamorelin | Pre-sleep | Evening/Pre-Sleep | Synergistic GH pulse; fasted 2-3h |
| PT-141 | 30-60 min before desired effect | Flexible/Situational | Sexual function; not daily use |
| Melanotan-1/2 | Pre-sun exposure | Flexible/Situational | 30-60 min before UV exposure |
| Hexarelin | Morning or pre-workout | Morning/Pre-Workout | GH secretagogue with cardioprotective benefits |

**Key Rule**: GH-related peptides (Sermorelin, CJC-1295, Ipamorelin) work best on an empty stomach — avoid food 2-3 hours before administration.

## Safety Considerations

- **Joint stress**: Rapid muscle growth can stress connective tissue
- **Insulin sensitivity**: Monitor glucose metabolism
- **Hormone levels**: Some compounds affect endogenous hormone production
- **Individual variation**: Response varies significantly between individuals
