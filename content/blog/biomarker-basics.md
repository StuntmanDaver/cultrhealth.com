# Biomarker Basics: Reading Your Lab Results

Lab testing is fundamental to health optimization. But getting results is only the first step—understanding what they mean and how to use them is where the real value lies.

## Beyond "Normal" Ranges

### The Problem with Standard Ranges

Standard laboratory reference ranges are based on population averages—including people with undiagnosed conditions. A "normal" result means you fall within where 95% of the tested population falls, not necessarily where you should be for optimal health.

**Example: Fasting Glucose**
- Standard "normal" range: 70-99 mg/dL
- Optimal range: 70-85 mg/dL
- A reading of 95 mg/dL is "normal" but may indicate early metabolic dysfunction

### Optimal vs. Normal

| Marker | Normal Range | Optimal Range |
|--------|--------------|---------------|
| Fasting Glucose | 70-99 mg/dL | 70-85 mg/dL |
| HbA1c | <5.7% | <5.3% |
| hs-CRP | <3.0 mg/L | <1.0 mg/L |
| Total Testosterone (men) | 300-1000 ng/dL | 500-900 ng/dL |
| Vitamin D | 30-100 ng/mL | 50-80 ng/mL |
| Ferritin | 20-300 ng/mL | 50-150 ng/mL |

## Essential Biomarker Categories

### Metabolic Health

**Fasting Glucose**
- What it measures: Blood sugar after overnight fast
- Why it matters: Early indicator of insulin resistance
- Optimal: 70-85 mg/dL
- Red flags: Trending upward over time, >90 mg/dL consistently

**HbA1c (Glycated Hemoglobin)**
- What it measures: Average blood sugar over 2-3 months
- Why it matters: More stable than single glucose reading
- Optimal: <5.3%
- Context: Can be affected by red blood cell turnover

**Fasting Insulin**
- What it measures: Insulin levels in fasted state
- Why it matters: Early insulin resistance marker (often elevated before glucose)
- Optimal: <5-7 μIU/mL
- Note: Not always included in standard panels—request specifically

**HOMA-IR**
- What it is: Calculated insulin resistance score
- Formula: (Fasting glucose × Fasting insulin) / 405
- Optimal: <1.0
- Concerning: >2.0 indicates significant insulin resistance

### Lipid Panel

**Total Cholesterol**
- Limited value alone
- Context matters more than absolute number
- Very low levels (<150) may have other implications

**LDL Cholesterol**
- Traditional "bad" cholesterol
- Standard calculation can be inaccurate with high triglycerides
- LDL-P (particle number) or apoB more informative
- Optimal: Depends on cardiovascular risk

**HDL Cholesterol**
- "Good" cholesterol
- Higher generally better
- Optimal: >50 mg/dL (men), >60 mg/dL (women)
- Very high (>100) may not provide additional benefit

**Triglycerides**
- Strongly influenced by diet and metabolic health
- Fasting level most accurate
- Optimal: <100 mg/dL
- Elevated = insulin resistance marker

**Advanced Lipid Markers**

| Marker | What It Tells You | Optimal |
|--------|-------------------|---------|
| LDL-P | Number of LDL particles | <1000 nmol/L |
| apoB | Atherogenic particle count | <80 mg/dL |
| Lp(a) | Genetic CVD risk factor | <30 mg/dL |
| sdLDL | Small dense LDL (more dangerous) | <20 mg/dL |

### Inflammatory Markers

**hs-CRP (High-Sensitivity C-Reactive Protein)**
- What it measures: General systemic inflammation
- Why it matters: Cardiovascular risk, overall inflammatory burden
- Optimal: <1.0 mg/L
- Elevated by: Infection, injury, chronic disease, obesity, poor diet

**Homocysteine**
- What it measures: Amino acid linked to cardiovascular risk
- Why it matters: Inflammation, methylation status
- Optimal: <8 μmol/L
- Affected by: B vitamins (B12, folate, B6)

**Fibrinogen**
- What it measures: Clotting protein
- Why it matters: Inflammation and cardiovascular risk
- Optimal: 200-300 mg/dL
- Context: Acute phase reactant

### Hormone Panel

**Testosterone (Men)**
- Total testosterone: Overall level
- Free testosterone: Bioavailable portion
- SHBG: Binding protein (affects free T)
- Timing: Morning draw (7-10 AM) essential

**Thyroid Panel**
- TSH: Pituitary signal to thyroid
- Free T4: Inactive thyroid hormone
- Free T3: Active thyroid hormone
- Reverse T3: Can indicate conversion issues

| Thyroid Marker | Standard Range | Optimal Range |
|----------------|----------------|---------------|
| TSH | 0.4-4.0 mIU/L | 0.5-2.0 mIU/L |
| Free T4 | 0.8-1.8 ng/dL | 1.0-1.5 ng/dL |
| Free T3 | 2.3-4.2 pg/mL | 3.0-4.0 pg/mL |

**Cortisol**
- Stress hormone with circadian rhythm
- Morning levels should be highest
- Four-point cortisol (saliva) more informative than single blood draw
- DHEA-S ratio provides additional context

### Nutrients and Vitamins

**Vitamin D (25-OH)**
- Widespread deficiency in modern populations
- Optimal: 50-80 ng/mL
- Most people need supplementation
- Test before and after supplementing

**Vitamin B12**
- Energy, neurological function, methylation
- Optimal: >500 pg/mL
- Serum level can be normal with functional deficiency
- MMA (methylmalonic acid) more sensitive

**Ferritin**
- Iron storage
- Too low: fatigue, poor exercise performance
- Too high: inflammation, iron overload
- Optimal: 50-150 ng/mL
- Context: Acute phase reactant (elevated with inflammation)

**RBC Magnesium**
- Serum magnesium often normal despite deficiency
- RBC level more accurate
- Optimal: 5.2-6.5 mg/dL
- Critical for 300+ enzymatic reactions

### Organ Function

**Liver Panel**
- AST/ALT: Liver enzymes
- Optimal: <25 U/L for both
- Elevated by: Fatty liver, alcohol, medications, intense exercise
- GGT: Sensitive marker for fatty liver

**Kidney Function**
- Creatinine and BUN: Waste product clearance
- eGFR: Calculated filtration rate
- Cystatin C: More accurate GFR estimate
- Optimal eGFR: >90 mL/min

**Complete Blood Count (CBC)**
- Red blood cells, white blood cells, platelets
- Hemoglobin/hematocrit: Oxygen-carrying capacity
- MCV: Red blood cell size (B12/folate status)
- WBC differential: Immune cell types

## Interpreting Your Results

### Look for Patterns

Single lab values have limited meaning. Look for:

**Trends Over Time**
- Is a marker moving in the right direction?
- Stable values vs. fluctuating values
- Rate of change can be informative

**Clusters of Related Markers**
- Metabolic syndrome pattern: High triglycerides + low HDL + elevated glucose + elevated insulin
- Inflammation pattern: High hs-CRP + elevated ferritin + elevated fibrinogen
- Thyroid pattern: TSH, T3, T4 together

**Context**
- Recent illness, injury, or stress
- Medication effects
- Timing of blood draw
- Fasting status

### Common Patterns and What They Mean

**Pattern: Metabolic Dysfunction**
- Elevated fasting glucose (>90)
- Elevated fasting insulin (>7)
- High triglycerides (>100)
- Low HDL (<50)
- Elevated hs-CRP
- **Action**: Address insulin resistance through diet, exercise, possibly medication

**Pattern: Inflammation**
- Elevated hs-CRP (>2)
- Elevated ferritin
- Elevated homocysteine
- **Action**: Identify source, anti-inflammatory interventions

**Pattern: Suboptimal Thyroid**
- TSH >2.5 (even if "normal")
- Low-normal Free T3
- Elevated Reverse T3
- **Action**: Further thyroid investigation, address root causes

**Pattern: Nutrient Deficiencies**
- Low vitamin D (<40)
- Low B12 (<500)
- Low ferritin (<50)
- Low RBC magnesium
- **Action**: Targeted supplementation, dietary optimization

## Creating Your Testing Strategy

### Baseline Panel

For comprehensive baseline, consider:

**Essential**
- Comprehensive metabolic panel
- Complete blood count
- Lipid panel with LDL-P or apoB
- HbA1c and fasting insulin
- hs-CRP
- Thyroid panel (TSH, Free T4, Free T3)
- Vitamin D
- B12 and folate

**For Men**
- Total and free testosterone
- SHBG
- Estradiol
- PSA (over 40)

**For Women**
- Estradiol, progesterone (cycle-appropriate timing)
- Testosterone
- DHEA-S

### Testing Frequency

| Category | Frequency |
|----------|-----------|
| Comprehensive panel | Annually minimum |
| Specific concerns | Every 3-6 months |
| On treatment | Per protocol (often quarterly initially) |
| Stable optimization | Every 6-12 months |

### Preparing for Labs

**Timing**
- Morning draw (7-10 AM) for hormone-sensitive tests
- Consistent timing for comparison
- Note cycle day for women

**Fasting**
- 10-14 hours for metabolic markers
- Water is fine (stay hydrated)
- Hold supplements day of draw

**Activity**
- Avoid intense exercise 24-48 hours before
- Get adequate sleep night before
- Note if you're acutely ill

## Working with Your Data

### Tracking Progress

Create a system to track:
- All lab values over time
- Interventions made between tests
- How you feel correlating to numbers
- Patterns and trends

### Questions for Your Provider

Come prepared with:
- Summary of changes since last labs
- Specific values you want to discuss
- Questions about optimal ranges vs. reported ranges
- Treatment options for suboptimal markers

### Don't Treat Numbers in Isolation

Remember:
- You're treating the person, not the number
- Symptoms matter alongside labs
- Context is crucial
- Goals influence targets

## Key Takeaways

1. **Optimal ≠ Normal**: Standard ranges represent population averages, not ideal health
2. **Patterns matter**: Look at clusters of related markers, not isolated values
3. **Trends over time**: Single values are snapshots; track changes
4. **Context is crucial**: Timing, fasting, stress, illness all affect results
5. **Comprehensive testing**: Standard panels miss important markers
6. **Work with experts**: Partner with providers who understand optimization
7. **Take action**: Labs are only useful if they guide interventions
